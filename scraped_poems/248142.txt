Where is the word I want?

Groping
in the thicket,
about to pinch the
dangling
berry, my fingerpads
close on
air.

I can hear it
scrabbling like a squirrel
on the oak's far side.
  
Word, please send over this black stretch of ocean
your singular flare,
blaze
your topaz in the mind's blank.

I could always pull the gift
from the lucky-dip barrel,
scoop the right jewel 
from my dragon's trove....

Now I flail,
the wrong item creaks up
on the mental dumbwaiter.

No use—
it's turning
out of sight,
a bicycle down a 
Venetian alley—
I clatter after, only to find
gondolas bobbing in sunny silence,
a pigeon mumbling something
I just can't catch.

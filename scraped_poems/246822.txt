You're speeding me down the Ventura freeway 
in your battered Scout, patched since your angry 
crash into the drunken pole that swerved into your road. 
We've got no seat belts, no top, bald tires, 
so I clutch any metal that seems as though it might 
be firm, belie its rusted rattling. Under my 
August burn I'm fainting white, but I'm trying 
to give you what you want: an easy mother.

For the last two days you've been plugged 
into your guitar, earphones on, door closed. I spoiled 
our holiday with warnings about your accidental 
life, said this time I wouldn't rescue you, knowing 
you'd hate me, knowing I'd make myself sick. We're 
speaking now, the airport is so near, New York closer 
than my birthday tomorrow, close as bearded death 
whose Porsche just cut us off in the fast lane.

When you were three, you asked if God lived 
under the street. I said I didn't know, although 
a world opened under my feet walking with you 
over strange angels, busy arranging our fate. Soon, 
if we make it, I'll be in the air, where people say God lives, 
the line between you and me stretched thinner, 
thinner but tight enough still to bind us, 
choke us both with love. Your Scout, putty-colored 
as L.A. mornings, protests loudly but hangs on.

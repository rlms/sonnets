In nyc, we stalked fishes 
              in filets of sounds: delivery 
              engines & ashy doors 

clapping shut, vendors
knuckling fin & silhouette-

             shaped words into salty 
expectations. My daughter 

& I walked down a couple 
              of  slim-bricked blocks 
              that smelled like snapper 

& afro sheen with no afros 
in sight. On snaggletoothed 

streets, we double-took the wet 
alleys where things jumped 

off the hook like smart seafood 
              before lunch. We parted 

the perfect & abundantly wintered 

streets. My daughter said, I know
these parts

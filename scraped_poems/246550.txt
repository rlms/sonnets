I

Where every town was a tidy town 
and every garden a hanging garden. 
A half could be had for half a crown. 
Every major artery would harden

since every meal was a square meal. 
Every clothesline showed a line of undies 
yet no house was in dishabille. 
Every Sunday took a month of Sundays

till everyone got it off by heart
every start was a bad start
since all conclusions were foregone.

Every wood had its twist of woodbine. 
Every cliff its herd of fatalistic swine. 
Every runnel was a Rubicon.


II

Every runnel was a Rubicon 
and every annual a hardy annual 
applying itself like linen to a lawn. 
Every glove compartment held a manual

and a map of the roads, major and minor. 
Every major road had major roadworks. 
Every wishy-washy water diviner 
had stood like a bulwark

against something worth standing against. 
The smell of incense left us incensed 
at the firing of the fort.

Every heron was a presager
of some disaster after which, we'd wager,
every resort was a last resort.


III

Every resort was a last resort
with a harbor that harbored an old grudge.
Every sale was a selling short.
There were those who simply wouldn't budge

from the Dandy to the Rover.

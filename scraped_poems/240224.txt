She does this thing. Our seventeen- 
year-old dog. Our mostly deaf dog. 
Our mostly dead dog, statistically 
speaking. When I crouch. 
When I put my mouth to her ear 
and shout her name. She walks away. 
Walks toward the nothing of speech. 
She even trots down the drive, ears up, 
as if my voice is coming home. 
It's like watching a child 
believe in Christmas, right 
before you burn the tree down. 
Every time I do it, I think, this time 
she'll turn to me. This time 
she'll put voice to face. This time, 
I'll be absolved of decay. 
Which is like being a child 
who believes in Christmas 
as the tree burns, as the drapes catch, 
as Santa lights a smoke 
with his blowtorch and asks, want one?

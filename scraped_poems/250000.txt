The poem in which we drive an hour to the beach and Uncle Dave doesn't get out 
         of his lawn chair once. 
The poem in which we left the yellow plastic shovel behind and everyone is bereft. 
The poem in which I can't stop talking about how you walked deep into Lake Erie 
         and the water was still only up to your knees when you turned into a speck 
         past the rock jetty. 
The poem in which everyone listens to celebrity gossip in the car on the way back. 
The poem in which I pontificate on how ugly the fiancée of that Jonas brother is, 
         and how they're too young to get married, and how my grandmother's old 
         neighbor would have said, "Ugly? She can't help that she's ugly. It's that she's 
         so stupid," and I would have yelled at her for assuming that all former hair- 
         dressers are dim.
 The poem in which I turn into my grandmother's old neighbor.
 The poem in which I remember very clearly how they both stored tissues in their 
          bras. 
The poem in which I think about how this would horrify your mother—the 
          pendulous breasts, the moist tissues, the dipping into the cleavage to retrieve 
          anything. 
The poem in which your mother tries not to wince when I order whatever I want
          from the menu despite her coupon for two medium 1-topping pizzas.
 The poem in which I try to find a deeper meaning for why I notice the woman 
          ahead of us in line at Johnny's Liquor Store who buys a pack of menthols and        
          asks the guy behind the counter if he knows her good-for-nothing brother. She 
          has hair that looks like cats got at a skein of yarn, and a tattoo above her ankle 
          that's dark and unspecified. It's far enough above her ankle that it's nearly mid-
          calf—like her ankle and calf are two different countries and the tattoo got lost 
          in the borderlands on the way to its actual destination. 
The poem in which I am territory that is under dispute and no one will occupy it 
          because of fear and uncertainty.
 The poem in which I reach the conclusion that this feeling is inspired by your 
          mother and the way she hums out-of-season carols while doing kitchen tasks, 
          though it's not really about the humming but rather the time she asked me to 
          light the Hanukkah candles in the attic because it would be better if they were 
          out of the way for the Christmas party. 
The poem in which you and I are in line waiting to buy a mixed six-pack of Great
          Lakes and I am staring at a stranger's tattoo and thinking about the fact that I
          am not Anne Frank while the baby is in the car with your mother. 
The poem in which I go into Walmart and buy the baby an olive-green cap that
          looks suspiciously like Fidel Castro's. 
The poem in which I could eradicate the fact that I ever went into Walmart and
          bought anything so the baby can one day start a revolution. 
The poem in which we see a couple on the highway median in a stalled-out Buick
          and don't stop to help.
 The poem in which the highway median looks like the spit of land between two
          enemy trenches and I feel a deep longing for my childhood.
 The poem in which I remember, for no apparent reason, the tornado instructions
          taped to the sides of all the filing cabinets in one office I worked in that was on
          the top floor of a mostly abandoned mall in Overland Park, Kansas. All that
          was left: decorative fountains, floor tiles, mirrored ceilings, Nearly Famous
          Pizza, the carcass of Sears. 
The poem in which we leave Northeastern Ohio, The poem in which we return to
          Northeastern Ohio. 
The poem in which it is night and we are lost in Northeastern Ohio and we keep
          passing Amish buggies adorned with reflective tape. 
The poem in which the moon is a vehicle for content, and is far less than a perfect
          reflector of anything. 
The poem in which we are all in some kind of limbo.

You may know me, watchful one, by my alias
Old Man, Buccaneer, Water Strider, Bilious
Busted Monometer of Planetary Celsius.
No? Go fuck yourself. I'm listening to Delius,
“On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring,” envious
Of ovenbirds, swallows, swifts, clamorous canaries; furious
At the soft-bedded shale and its gaseous
Nonlethal vapors. I'm not laughing. I'm hilarious.
I have a problem, it does, they do, you, him, I, us,
All creatures craven and judicious
Having departed in kayaks and fuming Kias.
Has it not been foretold, Leviticus, lascivious
One? — The way you bade us kneel, twisted like a Möbius
Belt, before insinuating your noxious
Nectar — omnivorous, odoriferous, officious
Orifice-filler, you. In a previous
Proxy you descended, empty charioteer, to query us
About our outerwear's whereabouts. Think on it, Rufous-
Headed woodpecker, use your barbed brain, be suspicious
Of high motives as you crown yourself on the dead tree as
Who comes to your rescue? Not I. Unconscious
Tremors, climbing the coils of the virtuous
Time-worn wooden flesh, leave me be. “Witty Is
As Witty Does,” sings the sorry fellow atop his eggs. Hush.
He'll sit through anything. As in days of yore, he is
Blooming, blazing, withering with his prize zinnias.

Under fluorescent light, 
aligned on a bench

and table top, oranges 
the size of marbles dangle

from trees with glossy 
leaves. White trumpets

bloom in tiny clay pots. 
Under a firethorn's twisted

limbs, a three inch monk 
holds a cup from which

he appears to drink 
the interior life. The potter

prizes his bonsai children 
who will never grow up,

never leave home.

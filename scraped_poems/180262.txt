The Pontalba Apartments in the View-Master 
and the cardboard cathedral as if trapped in the dream 
twenty years early, the whole a furious search 
as if for a reason. Still, it's sex that spoils it, isn't it? 

Jackson Square was the smallest sufficient landscape, 
but that was before, and now the gates are locked 
at sundown, and the smell of the river fails, 
falls ever backward. Some of us lived there, though: 
What shall we say who have knowledge 
carried to the heart?

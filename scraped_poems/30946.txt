Take hold of the bitter end; 
pass carefully around 
the standing part, 
being mindful of the bight. 
Finish with a round turn, 
make the knot up tight 
and it will not slip under load. 

But you'll find it not 
so easily undone; 
dangerous in the dark and cold 
and wet, when it matters most. 
These knots command allegiances. 

The Turk's head and midshipman's bend, 
the lighterman's hitch and 
the hangman's noose. 
See what names mean: 
Knots are men. 

Facing pageâ€”a simple eye-splice. 
Apply a whipping at the end 
so no strands come loose 
in the braid. The knot will hold 
Anything you care to bind.

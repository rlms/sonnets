I used to think the land 
had something to say to us, 
back when wildflowers 
would come right up to your hand 
as if they were tame.

Sooner or later, I thought, 
the wind would begin to make sense 
if I listened hard 
and took notes religiously. 
That was spring.

Now I'm not so sure: 
the cloudless sky has a flat affect 
and the fields plowed down after harvest 
seem so expressionless, 
keeping their own counsel.

This afternoon, nut tree leaves 
blow across them 
as if autumn had written us a long letter, 
changed its mind, 
and tore it into little scraps.

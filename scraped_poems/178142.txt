A heritage of a sort. 
A heritage of comradeship and suffocation. 

The bawling pit-hooter and the god's   
explosive foray, vengeance, before retreating   
to his throne of sulphur. 

Now this black-robed god of fossils 
and funerals, 
petrifier of underground forests 
and flowers, 
emerges with his grim retinue 
past a pony's skeleton, past human skulls, 
into his half-propped up, empty, carbon colony. 

Above, on the brutalised, 
unstitched side of a Welsh mountain, 
it has to be someone from somewhere else   
who will sing solo 

not of the marasmus of the Valleys,   
the pit-wheels that do not turn,   
the pump-house abandoned; 

nor of how, after a half-mile fall   
regiments of miners' lamps   
no longer, midge-like, 
rise and slip and bob. 

Only someone uncommitted,   
someone from somewhere else,   
panorama-high on a coal-tip,   
may jubilantly laud 
the re-entry of the exiled god   
into his shadowless kingdom. 

He, drunk with methane, 
raising a man's femur like a sceptre; 
she, his ravished queen, 
admiring the blood-stained black roses 
that could not thrive on the plains of Enna.

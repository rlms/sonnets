My mother sends the baby pictures she promisedâ€” 
egg hunting in Shelby Park, wooden blocks 
and Thumbelina tossed on the rug, knotty pine 
walls in a house lost to memory. I separate out
the early ones, studying my navel or crumbs 
on the tray, taken before my awareness 
of Sylvania Superflash. Here I am sitting 
on the dinette table, the near birthday cake 
striking me dumb. Two places of wedding china, 
two glasses of milk, posed for the marvelous 
moment: the child squishes the fluted rosettes, 
mother claps her hands, father snaps the picture 
in the face of time. When the sticky sweet
is washed off the page, we are pasted in an album 
of blessed amnesia. The father leaves the pine house 
and sees the child on weekends, the mother 
stores the china on the top shelf until it's dull and crazed, 
the saucer-eyed girl grips her curved spoon 
like there's no tomorrow.

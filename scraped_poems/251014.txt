How it must have been for them, when wind came
to strike cottonwoods they called home down

—silver bridges across a gun-smoke creek-bed, joining
yellow meadow to meadow...how it must have been

like the beginning of time, when the first one beat
great wings (though so silent a field mouse

would never even hear before talons sinking in...) and
rose over the Blues to find this valley with others

following. And their human eyes, forward-gazing
in their round faces, they turned toward sound

to catch it in feather discs, their hearing tuned beyond
human imagining...and then they were gone, like

mist dissipating in the lowlands, and an eye trained
toward their going might, squinting, distinguish

signs of intention written by pinions, stroking damp
air in their westward rowing. And we told ourselves

all water eventually finds the sea—our coming, their
going—so synchronous; this was simply something

we wanted, more than knowing, wholly to believe.

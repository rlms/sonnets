In the portrait of Jefferson that hangs
         at Monticello, he is rendered two-toned: 
 his forehead white with illumination —

 a lit bulb — the rest of his face in shadow,
         darkened as if the artist meant to contrast 
 his bright knowledge, its dark subtext.

 By 1805, when Jefferson sat for the portrait,
         he was already linked to an affair 
 with his slave. Against a backdrop, blue

 and ethereal, a wash of paint that seems
         to hold him in relief, Jefferson gazes out 
 across the centuries, his lips fixed as if

 he's just uttered some final word.
         The first time I saw the painting, I listened 
 as my father explained the contradictions:
  
 how Jefferson hated slavery, though — out 
         of necessity, my father said — had to own 
 slaves; that his moral philosophy meant
  
 he could not have fathered those children:
         would have been impossible, my father said. 
 For years we debated the distance between

 word and deed. I'd follow my father from book
         to book, gathering citations, listening 
 as he named — like a field guide to Virginia — 

 each flower and tree and bird as if to prove 
         a man's pursuit of knowledge is greater 
 than his shortcomings, the limits of his vision.

 I did not know then the subtext
         of our story, that my father could imagine 
 Jefferson's words made flesh in my flesh —
  
 the improvement of the blacks in body
         and mind, in the first instance of their mixture 
 with the whites

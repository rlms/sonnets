every wall 
stood at attention 
even the air knew 
when to hold its breath 
the polished floors 
looked up 
defying heel marks 
the plastic slipcovers 
crinkled in discomfort 

in my mother's house 
the window shades 
flapped 
against the glare 
of the world 
the laughter 
crawled like roaches 
back into the cracks 

even the humans sat— 
cardboard cut-outs 
around the formica 
kitchen table 
and with silver knives 
sliced and swallowed 
their words

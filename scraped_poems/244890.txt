Einstein's happiest moment 
occurred when he realized 
a falling man falling 
beside a falling apple
could also be described 
as an apple and a man at rest 
while the world falls around them.

And my happiest moment 
occurred when I realized 
you were falling for me, 
right down to the core, and the rest, 
relatively speaking, has flown past 
faster than the speed of light.

When I take my scissors to your shirts, 
I am frightened: not that they will whimper
But that they won't understand the violence I mean. 
That kind of violence is the other side of love,

Bright as a light-saber and permanent 
As the angel's swords above Eden 
Barring that couple with a final X, 
That violence means a love strong as death.

Once Sie ist mein leben, you said, meaning me 
And I took those words personally 
And knocked upon the door of my heart 
Until all its birds flooded to you, in a rushâ€”

Like the Iroquois, I tugged on our peace-pipe, 
I wrote your name in smoke. Then went home 
With my pockets rolling in shining glass beads, 
My pockets so rich with the coin of your country.

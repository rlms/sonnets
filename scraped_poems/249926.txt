Let's not wrestle with water
anymore—
Enters until we flexible
in its acceptance
Persistent in entering
through green or brown windowpanes
jagged from years of sun

Lights out
across the street yr candle
dances still or
flashlight we send
signals
interrupted by slinging branches
Tonight is O.K.—
after all
you walk by the window
tip yr head at the orange sky blue lightning
partially our rainbow

People not alone in the percussive squalls
(Caribbean music)
Sole leaf flicked by adolescent wind
gone

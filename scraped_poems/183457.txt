Paulatim lachrymas rerum experentia tersit.  Petrarch
Father's books lying on the living-room floor 
Must be divided into threes: art history, 
Classical letters and, left from my days here, 
Unsteady stacks of quasi-educational lore 
That show yellowing Geographic scientists 
Perennially lost in rain forest mists. 
An instant choice will cull some from the rest 
So they may become mine—a banausic test. 

Prewar light glimmers in the apartment: 
A shadowplay that summons an adolescence 
Of slammed doors and risible nothings 
Hurled at retreating parental backs 
—The most telling blows always sotto voce— 
As I stormed and wept and read in silence. 
Now, standing again in silence, I stare 
At a word trove given two sons to share.

For Eardrum
First hold the needle
     like a lover's hand
Lower it slowly
      let it tongue
      the record's ear
Then cultivate
      the sweet beats
      blooming in the valley
      of the groove
Laugh at folks
      that make requests
What chef would let
      the diners determine
Which entrees
      make up the menu?
Young boys
      think it's about
      flashy flicks
      of the wrist
But it's about filling the floor
      with the manic
      language of dance
About knowing the beat
      of every record
      like a mama knows
      her child's cries
Nobody cares
      how fast you scratch
Cuz it ain't about
      soothing any itch
It's about how many hairstyles
     are still standing
At the end of the night.

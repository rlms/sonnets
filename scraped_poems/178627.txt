To be poor and raise skinny children. 
To own nothing but skinny clothing. 
Skinny food falls in between cracks. 
Friends cannot visit your skinny home. 
They cannot fit through the door. 
Your skinny thoughts evaporate into 
the day or the night that you cannot 
see with your tiny eyes. 

God sticks you with the smallest pins 
and your blood, the red is diluted. 
Imagine a tiny hole, the other side 
of which is a fat world and how 
lost you would feel. Of course, 
I'm speaking to myself. 
How lost I would feel, and how dangerous.

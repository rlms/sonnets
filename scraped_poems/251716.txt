You by whom my youth was destroyed—who have built up your life upon the ruins of mine!  Would I could kill you!”   And the daughter spoke, and she said:  “O hateful woman, selfish and old!  Who stand between my freer self and me!  Who would have my life an echo of your own faded life!  Would you were dead!”   At that moment a cock crew, and both women awoke.  The mother said gently, “Is that you, darling?”  And the daughter answered gently, “Yes, dear.”

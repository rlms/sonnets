for Cosetta
Once there were coyotes, cardinals
 in the cedar. You could cure amnesia
 with the trees of our back-forty. Once
 I drowned in a monsoon of frogs—
 Grandma said it was a good thing, a promise 
for a good crop. Grandma's perfect tomatoes. 
Squash. She taught us to shuck corn, laughing, 
never spoke about her childhood
 or the faces in gingerbread tins
 stacked in the closet. 

 She was covered in a quilt, the Creek way. 
But I don't know this kind of burial: 
vanishing toads, thinning pecan groves, 
peach trees choked by palms. 
 New neighbors tossing clipped grass 
over our fence line, griping to the city 
of our overgrown fields. 

 Grandma fell in love with a truck driver, 
grew watermelons by the pond
 on our Indian allotment,
 took us fishing for dragonflies. 
 When the bulldozers came
 with their documents from the city 
and a truckload of pipelines,
 her shotgun was already loaded. 

 Under the bent chestnut, the well 
where Cosetta's husband
 hid his whiskey—buried beneath roots
 her bundle of beads. They tell
 the story of our family.

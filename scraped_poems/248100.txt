A shack in a series of shacks. With nooks and garrets and stairs. This is your corner of the world. Thick with suspicious walls. Or. I am backpedaling through my Motionless Childhood. For. A box for the keeping of birds. A place of worship. As. A church. Entertainment. As. A tavern. For. To be quit of you I confine myself to the house. Or. I am living alone in such emptiness. Burying my Lares in the basement. But. If this house should come to ruin, I am trying hard to fix the dispersed days. When you haunted this house of horror. Or. I am furnshing my house with memory. As. Locomotives and other forgettings.Inmates collectively. For. A daughter who brings the house down. The harder shell of a snail. Or. A tortoise. As. The swallow builds its own indent. Of wood, or stone, or clay. Protection from weather. Protection again from time. The first principle of architecture From which all things extend. But. Until you hit the boy in the back with a bottle, this is but a barroom box. Where six tall men play gilded guitars. Two which ways and ever which time. For. These are my lullaby lies. And. This house has memory of home.The I and the not I. As. Protection of I. Divisions of the brain. For. A receptacle of any kind. A twelve parts of heaven. Or. The entire sky. Excepting parts that never rise. For. A sign of the zodiac is considered the seat. Where artificers may be heard. But If seven children play at house, fireside things lie in the brush. Or. What is more beautiful than a road? A roof and a roost. A den and my digs. I am confined as by illness. To stay in this house without purpose.

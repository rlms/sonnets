We set great wreaths of brightness on the graves of the passionate 
who required tribute of hot July flowers— 
for you, O brittle-hearted, we bring offering 
remembering how your wrists were thin and your delicate bones 
not yet braced for conquering. 

The sharp cries of ghost-boys are keen above the meadows, 
and little girls continue graceful and wondering. 
Flickering evening on the lakes recalls those young 
heirs whose developing years have sunk to earth, 
their strength not tested, their praise unsung. 

Weave grasses for their childhood—who will never see 
love or disaster or take sides against decay 
balancing the choices of maturity. 
Silent and coffined in silence while we pass 
loud in defiance of death, the helpless lie. 


October 1935

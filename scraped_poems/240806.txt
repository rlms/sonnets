I was arrested because of that internal memo, 
and ended up in a cell, then I was told to sit 
with the police and the local bigwigs. 
In the hushed and fast darkening room they said 
someone—someone—had reduced the safety margin 
on the airport risk factor, and I got the blame. 
The sky that day was a pale, clear blue, but 
that was happening outside, and far away. 

The cop on duty would not open the tomb 
of the deported—sorry, departed—and as usual 
he had a story. Every movie, he said, depends 
on a script, and the narrative grows out of 
market research: a set of standard deviations. Art? 
What would they know? Open the tomb, and let me in.

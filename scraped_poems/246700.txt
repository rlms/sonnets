Despite that you 
wrote your name 
and number
on its fuselage 
in magic marker

neither your quiet 
hours at the kitchen
table assembling
it with glue

nor your choice of
paint and lacquer

nor your seemingly
equally perfect 
choice of a seemingly 
breezeless day
for the launch of
your ambition

nor the thrill 
of its swift ignition

nor the heights
it streaks

nor the dancing
way you chase
beneath its 

dot

across that
seemingly endless
childhood field

will ever be 
restored to you 

by the people
in the topmost
branches of whose trees

unseen

it may yet from 
its plastic 
chute
on thin 
white 
string

still swing.

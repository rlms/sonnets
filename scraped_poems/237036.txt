“Nothing but sunlight and gleaming, 
linoleum flecked with flame,
a thick coat of wax that flashed
down a corridor and led to a room,
a place where I curled up a few 
innocuous inches off the floor. 
Straps—word out of strophe,
the restraints of line and stanza—
straps hung in loops on closet hooks. 
On the nightstand a basket with 
peanut butter crackers, a vivid 
and unnatural orange, a crinkly 
wrap. A knee-high fridge stocked 
with icy juices, foil boxes, straws 
glued on. A female voice next door 
claimed she was still a human being, 
though I could not hear the reasons. 
When it was my turn, I answered 
right away, saying I knew where 
I was and why. No, I would not 
harm myself, surprised to be asked 
as I had never had the thought. 
Yes I knew where I was going next. 
Out the window and through shadow 
and streetlight, I saw how this building 
connected to the next. I was to follow 
a stripe painted on the wall. Someone 
would walk with me as well. I felt fine 
I said, and it was sort of true. Actually 
I felt nailed by one wrist to a desire 
to flee and by the other to a sincere 
longing for sleep. I was not in pain. 
Thank you. I felt like the very last note 
in a concert, the one that hovers as if 
it wants to linger, but is already over.”

I guess it's too late to live on the farm

I guess it's too late to enter the darkened room in which a single light 
illuminated the artist stripped from the waist down, smeared with 
blood, stretched and bound to the table

I guess it's too late to inhabit a glass-fronted, white, box-like room, 
dressed in white, against which the menstrual blood was visible

I guess it's too late to start farming

I guess it's too late to start struggling to remain standing in a 
transparent plastic cubicle filled with wet clay, repeatedly slipping and 
falling

I guess it's too late to buy 60,000 acres in Marfa

I guess it's too late to begin appearing on the subway in stinking 
clothes during rush hour with balloons attached to her ears, nose, hair 
and teeth

I guess we'll never have an orgiastic Happening

I guess we're too old to carry out maintenance activities in public 
spaces, during public hours

I guess we couldn't afford to simulate masturbation while President 
Josip Broz Tito's motorcade drove by below

I guess we're not suited to "I am awake in the place where women die"

I guess we'll never have a self-inflicted wound in front of an audience now

I guess entering a sex cinema dressed in a black shirt, jeans with the 
crotch removed, and a machine gun slung over her shoulder is not in 
the cards now

I guess Clive wouldn't make a good photographic montage in which 
their male and female faces became almost indistinguishable

I guess I can't expect we'll ever have a selection of photographs derived 
from images produced by the beauty industry now

I guess I'll have to give up all my dreams of being seen, clothed and 
unclothed, being systematically measured by two male 'researchers' 
who record her measurements on a chart and compare them with a set 
of 'normal' measurements

I guess I'll never be waiting for my body to break down, to get ugly

We couldn't get tied together by our hair anyways though Allen 
Ginsberg got one late in life

Maybe someday I'll have the foreshortened barrel of a gun pointing 
toward the viewer

I guess joining our hands around the base's perimeter fence into which 
they weave strands of wool is really out

Feeding the pigs and the chickens, walking between miles of rows of crops

I guess examining women's working conditions is just too difficult

We'll never have a, never-really-a-collective, a group of women who 
came together to work on a public mural

Too much work and still to be poets

Who are the simultaneously-the-beneficiary-of-our-cultural-heritage-
and-a-victim-of-it-poets

Was there ever a poet who had a self-sufficient loss of certainty

Flannery O'Connor raised peacocks

And Wendell Berry has raised large-scale spirals of rusted industrial 
materials in incongruous natural and commercial spaces

Faulkner may have spent three days in a gallery with a coyote, a little

And Robert Frost asked a friend to shoot him at close range with a .22

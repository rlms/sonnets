His daughter pulls on
            her father's frayed dishdasha
                                      to go check the bees.
 

 Today she doesn't
             carry the smoke canister
                                     with her to the field.
 

 She opens a tray
             while talking down their high whine,
                                     breaks off honeycomb
 

 and rubs it over
             her face and hair, over white
                                     cloth, down to her feet.
 

 Each of her hands holds
             the crumbling comb like a sponge 
                                     while she waits for them.
 

 When the first one comes
             she feels wings against her toes,
                                     a tongue unscrolling.
 

 She wills herself not
             to laugh as the next alights
                                     on her neck, tickling
 

 her hairs as it walks.
             Then they descend to shoulders, 
                                     forearms, chest, thighs, eyes
 

 she shuts—she feels the
             thousand tongues on the cloth. 
                                     Feather-like wings churn
 

 in her ears, rustle
             and hum with agitated talk.
                                     Never been so loved.
 

 Her father's alive, 
             she's a torch of burning bees,
                                     tears course across cheeks.
 

 When her mother sees
             the apparition of bees
                                     walking towards their door
 

 she falls on her knees. 
             It is the end of the world.
                                     But when the angel
 

 speaks with her daughter's
             voice she's not amazed. Mama, 
                                     how do I end this?
 

 Her mother brushes
             bees away from her eyes, pulls
                                     them from her hair and
 

 undresses her child,
             hanging the winged dishdasha
                                     on the clothes line.
 

 Carries her naked
             girl into the house to bathe. 
                                     The bee-like angels
 

 take all day to strip
             honey from the robe, return 
                                     it to their tiered home.

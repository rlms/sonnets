Aluminum tank 
indifferent in its place 

behind a glass door 
in the passageway,

like a tea urn 
in a museum case;

screaming-machines 
that dumbly spend each day 

waiting for gas or smoke 
or hands or heat, 

positioned like beige land mines 
overhead, 

sanguine on walls,
or posted on the street 

like dwarf grandfather clocks 
spray painted red;

little gray hydrant 
in its warlike stance;

old fire escape,
all-weather paint job peeling,

a shelf for threadbare rugs 
and yellowing plants;

sprinkler heads, 
blooming from the public ceiling;

all sitting 
supernaturally still,

waiting for us to cry out.
And we will.

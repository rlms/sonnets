For a flag! I answered facetiously. A flag of tomorrow, 
fluent in fire, not just the whispers, lisps, not just the still there
of powdered wigs, dry winds. Who wants a speckled
drape that folds as easy over smirch as fallen soldier? 
This is rhetorical. Like, "What to the Negro
is the fourth of July?" A flag should be stitched with a fuse.

Jefferson said for each generation a flag. Maybe 
he said Constitution. I once raised a high-top flag 
of my hair, a fist, a leather medallion of the motherland. 
I studied heraldry and maniples (which are not 
what you might guess), little sails and banners 
down to the vane of a feather. Because his kids were 
rebel cities my father loved like Sherman. Because 
I wanted history I could touch like the flank of a beast.

My wife's people are from San Salvador. They sent us 
with a guard, his AK shouldered like a mandolin, among
anil-tinted shawls and jerseys, across tiled and pocked 
concrete, and the gated stalls of El Centra. I felt sacred
as a goat there, too, as I did below the Mason-Dixon 
where our only protection was the Fourteenth Amendment.

Afraid our Yankee plates would be read aggressive as a Jolly 
Roger we rented a compact in Atlanta. Charleston, Savannah, 
Montgomery, and after Birmingham we were broke. 
Skipped Selma. Slept at B&Bs where my dreams power-
washed layers of footnotes and Februaries, revealing
the surreal sheen of Apollo Creed's trunks, the apocalyptic 
Americana of Jacko moonwalking around a tinfoil Buzz 
Aldrin planting the corporate ensign. Years passed. I grew

youthless in my dad-pants, but still puffed at pinwheels 
and windsocks, launched glyphs of grillsmoke and one day 
it came to me, as if commissioned, Theaster Gates's Flag

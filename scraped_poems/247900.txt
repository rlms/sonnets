It is the hour of lamps.
 On our knees my mother
 and I, still young, color
 with crayons threadbare nap

 on the living room rug.
 Though there is no money,
 no one seems to care. We
 are self-possessed as bugs

 waving their antennae
 through cracks in the kitchen's
 linoleum floor. When
 Father begins to read

 from the red gilt volume
 in his lap, a circle
 of light encapsulates
 us like hearts in a womb.

 Except their marriage is
 already dead. I know
 this though I'm only six.
 So we visit pharaohs,

 a boatman on the Nile,
 Crusaders eating grapes
 on a beach. Life escapes
 with all its sadness while

 two tragic Greek poets
 inhabit Father's voice.
 Who'd know I am just a boy
 when he begins a stoic

 moral tale concerning
 a dull provincial doctor's
 young French wife? If Mother,
 in French, begins to sing

 to herself, I know she's
 had enough. Crayon stubs
 litter the crumbling rug.
 Our prostrate cat sneezes

 at the dust in her fur.
 And cries from a swallow
 remind us one swallow
 doesn't make a summer.

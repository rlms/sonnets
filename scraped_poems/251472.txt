I sang my songs so much
 that they became
 the soundtrack for my dreams,
 the melody of my moods,
 a room I lived in,
 and a balm for my wounds.
  
 I sang my songs enough 
to know them backward
 and forward, enough
 to wonder if they could lift me
 from hometown haunts
 to center stage.
  
 I'd sung my songs enough 
 to think I could take on
 Baltimore's best talent
 at the Harlem Theatre
 Amateur Hour
 and maybe even win.
  
 If you sing a song enough,
 it can go to your head that way.

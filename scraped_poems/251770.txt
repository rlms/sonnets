And there were those who looked with envy upon us, for Sorrow was a noble thing and I was proud with Sorrow.   But my Sorrow died, like all living things, and alone I am left to muse and ponder.   And now when I speak my words fall heavily upon my ears.   And when I sing my songs my neighbours come not to listen.   And when I walk the streets no one looks at me.   Only in my sleep I hear voices saying in pity, “See, there lies the man whose Sorrow is dead.”

I took back the night. Wrested it
from the Chinese, many of  whom
were shorter than me. 
Two billion outstretched Chinese
hands, give or take a few
thousand amputees.

A cheap knockoff, the night
proved to be — Nokla
not Nokia on the touchscreen.
Well, even Old Peng gotta eat,
Confucius say. Or maybe that
was Cassius Clay. 

In me, folks, a movable object
meets a resistible force. I haven't 
worked a day since the accident
of   birth. Born of  woman,
my father the same. Make love
then war. I'll bring round the car.

These children that I spit on
are immune to my consultations.
I'll have none myself. It isn't 
(Write it!) a fiasco. I am small, 
I contain platitudes.

I never much liked
forsythia, never
liked yellow, but
liked the sounds:
for     syth       i       a
for Kythera for sight
for sky for Sylvia.

Forsythia made an
okay divider between
our place and hers.
Sylvia used to trod
through it to see us
too often so we let
all of it grow massive

and dense hoping
she'd go blind in
it then hop aboard
a bumblebee who'd
follow his lovely great
queen as she flew to her
dream isle of Kythera.

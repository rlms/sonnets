Headscarf fluttering in the wind, 
stockings hanging loose on her vein-roped 
legs, an old woman clings to her husband

 as if he were the last tree standing in a storm, 
though he is not the strong one. 

His skin is translucentâ€”more like a window
 than a shade. Without a shirt and coat, 

we could see his lungs swell and shrink, 
his heart skip. But he has offered her his arm, 
and for sixty years, she has taken it.

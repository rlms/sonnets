These, in the days when heaven was falling, 
 The hour when earth's foundations fled, 
 Followed their mercenary calling 
 And took their wages and are dead.


Their shoulders held the sky suspended;
 They stood, and the earth's foundations stay; 
 What God abandoned, these defended, 
 And saved the sum of things for pay.

We are learning to control our thoughts, 
to set obtrusive thoughts aside.

It takes an American 
to do really big things.

Often I have no thoughts to push against.

It's lonely in a song 
about outer space.

When I don't have any thoughts, 
I want one!

A close-up reveals 
that she has chosen

a plastic soap dish
in the shape of a giant sea turtle.

Can a thought truly be mine
if I am not currently thinking it?

There are two sides
to any argument;

one arm
in each sleeve.

           •

Maybe I am always meditating,
 if by that you mean

searching for a perfect 
stranger.

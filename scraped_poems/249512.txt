It scares me to watch
a woman hobble along
the sidewalk, hunched adagio

leaning on —
there's so much fear
I could draw you a diagram

of the great reduction
all of us will soon
be way-back-when.

The wedding is over.
Summer is over.
Life please explain.

This book is nearly halfway read.
I don't have a pill for that,
the doctor said.

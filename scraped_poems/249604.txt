Your TV cable's on the fritz. 
Your Xbox is corroded. 
Your iPod sits in useless bits. 
Your Game Boy just imploded. 

Your cell phone? Static's off the scale. 
Your land line? Disconnected. 
You've got no mail—E, junk or snail. 
Your hard drive is infected. 

So here you idle, dumb and blue, 
with children, spouse and mother—
 and wish you knew what people do
 to entertain each other.

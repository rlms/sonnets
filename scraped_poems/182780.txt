My first week in Cambridge a car full of white boys 
tried to run me off the road, and spit through the window, 
open to ask directions. I was always asking directions 
and always driving: to an Armenian market 
in Watertown to buy figs and string cheese, apricots, 
dark spices and olives from barrels, tubes of paste 
with unreadable Arabic labels. I ate 
stuffed grape leaves and watched my lips swell in the mirror. 
The floors of my apartment would never come clean. 
Whenever I saw other colored people 
in bookshops, or museums, or cafeterias, I'd gasp, 
smile shyly, but they'd disappear before I spoke. 
What would I have said to them? Come with me? Take 
me home? Are you my mother? No. I sat alone 
in countless Chinese restaurants eating almond 
cookies, sipping tea with spoons and spoons of sugar. 
Popcorn and coffee was dinner. When I fainted 
from migraine in the grocery store, a Portuguese 
man above me mouthed: “No breakfast.” He gave me 
orange juice and chocolate bars. The color red 
sprang into relief singing Wagner's Walküre. 
Entire tribes gyrated and drummed in my head. 
I learned the samba from a Brazilian man 
so tiny, so festooned with glitter I was certain 
that he slept inside a filigreed, Fabergé egg. 
No one at the door: no salesmen, Mormons, meter 
readers, exterminators, no Harriet Tubman, 
no one. Red notes sounding in a grey trolley town.

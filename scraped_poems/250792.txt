walking to the hospital


How the autumn dawn burned through
the misty broods and settled down in fire;

how quickly the sun glittered my shadow,
how my shadow cried, a moment, with joy.

A light frost, a vision of light crackling
down the maples, down the tinder ash.

I was the good thief. I held my Love's
sweet breath, his beautiful, intelligent gaze.

I closed my eyes and he woke inside me.
When I saw, he saw the inflamed world.

A bird sang deeply from the gutter eaves.
When I closed my eyes I was elsewhere.

I walked through the fire of his sleep.

My Love, 
   tonight Fionnuala is your nurse. 
You'll hear her voice sing-song around the ward 
lifting a wing at the shore of your darkness. 
I heard that, in another life, she too journeyed 
through a storm, a kind of curse, with the ocean 
rising darkly around her, fierce with cold, 
and no resting place, only the frozen 
rocks that tore her feet, the light on her shoulders. 

And no cure there but to wait it out. 
If, while I'm gone, your fever comes down— 
if the small, salt-laden shapes of her song 
appear as a first glimmer of earth-light, 
follow the sweet, hopeful voice of that landing. 
She will keep you safe beneath her wing.



in your sleep



After “The Lark Ascending” by Ralph Vaughan Williams


The moment the lark finally vanishes 
into the spread green sky of the forest
 is the moment you suddenly lift 

your bruised arm up, over your body, 
as though to show me the wing's eclipse, 
or the wing, or the season of your dream. 

And even as your hand lapses silent 
onto your chest, and your breath goes 
sluggish, I am already watching your feet 

prepare their slow first step under the sheet 
as the last notes of sunlight fall quiet, 
and you do not move again. My love, 

are you a bird reviving in a summer field? 
Was it the lark ascending that you heard, 
a ghost among its shy-hearted tunes? 

Yes. I heard the lark escaping, too.

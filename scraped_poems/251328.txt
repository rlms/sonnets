Cookies for sale!
And cake! One dime!
That's what it says
on my cardboard sign.
I pile cookies on a plate.
I eat just one
and then, I wait . . . 
I taste the cake
(one tiny slice)
I squeeze the lemons
and stir the ice;
I count and stack
the paper cups . . . 
fresh lemonade
is coming up!
I count the bruises
on my knee . . .
won't somebody buy something,
please?

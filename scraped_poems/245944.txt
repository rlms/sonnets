My neighbor, 87, rings the doorbell to ask
 if I might have seen her clipping shears
 that went missing a decade ago,
 with a little red paint on their shaft,
 or the iron turkey bank and the porcelain
 coffee cup that disappeared a while back
 when her friend, now dead, called the police
 to break in to see if she were ill, and have we
 had trouble with our phone line, hers
 is dead and her car and driver's license
 are missing though she can drive perfectly
 well, just memory problems, and her son
 is coming this morning to take her up
 to Sheboygan, where she was born
 and where the family has its burial lots,
 to wait on assisted living space, and she
 just wanted to say we'd been good neighbors
 all these how many? years, and how lucky
 I am to have found such a nice man
 and could she borrow a screwdriver,
 the door lock to her house is jammed.

That's why we're here, said Julio Lugo
 to the Globe. Sox fans booed 
poor Lugo, booed his at-bat after 
he dropped the ball in the pivotal fifth.

That ball, I got to it, I just 
couldn't come up with it.

Lugo wants you to know
 he is fast: a slower player 
wouldn't even get close 
enough to get booed. Lugo 
wants you to know he's only 
human: We're human beings. 
That's why we're here. If not,

I would have wings.
I'd be beside God right now.
I'd be an angel.

But I'm not an angel.
I'm a human being that lives right here.

Next day, all
is forgiven. Lugo's home run, Lugo's
sweet comment to the press.

I wanted to make a poster like the ones that say
It's my birthday! or First Time at Fenway! or, pathetic, ESPN.
Posterboard, permanent marker to say Lugo: me, too.
I'm a human being that lives right here, decided
it's too esoteric, too ephemeral a reference, but it's true:
Oh, Lugo, Julio Lugo, I'm here with you.

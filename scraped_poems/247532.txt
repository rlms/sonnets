Let me break
                            free of these lace-frail 
                            lilac fingers disrobing
the black sky
                            from the windows of this 
                            room, I sit helpless, waiting,
silent—sister,
                            because you drew from me
                            the coil of red twine: loneliness—
spooled inside—
                            once, I wanted to say one 
                            true thing, as in, I want more
in this

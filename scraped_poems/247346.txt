I'm a'kickin' but not high,and I'm a'flappin' but I can't fly.          — Florence Church
A carpet of light, the
ocean alive < half a moon
muting the stars.

I tell myself
despair    is just

a bad attitude: Get up,
I say. Look — 
and the shimmer

spends its name
in my head.

These days    midlife
holds the jagged edge:

my nephew in prison,
a prisoner > friends insane

with work or sick
of trying to be loved,

my parents handing over their lives
like evidence: my good mother,

her mind     a trail of crumbs
in a woods flocked with birds.


                    --/--


To raise a child    break it
like a wild horse — 
bend the will: get up,
get dressed.

I remember Emlen School
staring me down, my lunch box,
September:
the spiked fence freshly painted.

Then, the goodbye from my mother
who'd fought my hard hair,
lipstick like mist on my cheek.

                    --/--

That instant when eyes meet
and slide away — even love
blinks, looks off

like a stranger.

With: Who are you
with?

                    --/--

I suspect     everything.

Outside the air moves
a giant bird I cannot see.

Still laced in this
brown body: my aging heart — 
a-loom     a-loomdoom —  
still minds my thoughts,

but rolls his eyes.

To see >< to be seen:  the life
of the visible.  Don't be shy.

Glances pick my face.

Once, I was a sperm and an egg,
but they didn't see me.

                    --/--

Too small to walk
alone: I held

my father's index
finger. Philadelphia police

caped in their black
jackets — big badges     almost

hungry — looking at us.

                    --/--

In a mall: say a food court
on Saturday     or a stadium
just before the game.

There's this drone, this
steady, muttering thrum

punctured by
packages — plastic this,
paper that — torn and torn.

“It's hard not to be hungry.”

                    --/--

Time     for bed: my
mother reading The
Three Little Pigs

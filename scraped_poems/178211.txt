You're gonna strike the match— 

You're gonna strike it— 

Flame the bank up into pods 
          of fire, be 

          a masterhand—   

                   — 

And someone said, Gasoline. 

Someone said, We have to change the images 
          inside their heads, said 

Gasoline? 

And motor oil, he bought at a mini-mart. 

                   — 

And the cat said Don't   
         even though it was dead 
and the squirrel said Don't 
and the little dog missing an eye and a leg 
         even though they were dead, said 

Don't Don't 

but you did it anyway. 

And someone said, That boy is sick— 
And someone said, It was kind of pretty 

         when you didn't know what it was from the road. 

                  — 

Hours now, by the trashed banks, counting 
         the colored 
glass— 

Brown for beer. Green 
         for the fizzy water, clear 
for anything and 
         tail lights smashed, cars mucked like 
big cats 
         trapped in tar, who 
ate the flesh right off their legs, if they were 
         lighter 
they could hurry home, they could float 
         on 
home— 

         killed cat dead at the end of your stick, who could   
do that, 
         shot in the head— 
      
         Like in the shows where the cop 
cleans up his town, 
         then the ambulance comes for the drowned. 

                 — 

You felt bad, so you did it. 

You thought it was pretty, so you 
         did it again. 

You felt charged and buoyant 
         as you picked your way home 

         to the blue-lit fatherless den— 

So you did it again. 

The BB'ed mutt, leg smashed, home-bum toasting you 
          with his beer as you 
dragged it 
          to the sludgy bank, the match, the gas, the 
pile of tires someone had dumped, were you 
          dumped? you had asked 
after another one left, and she had 
          slapped you, 
and slapped— 

You were an ambulance, you could see she had drowned— 

Like in the shows where the warrior 
         collects his dead and 
brings them to the shore, 
         to burn them 
in their body-boats, release 
         the spiritual 

                  — 

smoke— 

And the parents said,   
         Didn't he have a house key around his neck, 
didn't he have a pager, an electrical tether 
         to a list of chores and a stocked refrigerator— 

And the teachers said Yes, but what 
          were the images inside his head, they   
see it and they make it   
           be— 

And you put it in a tire, your 
          viking boat,   
you set it on fire and it kept afloat 
          as it sailed down the river— 
to the heaven of not being 
          here.

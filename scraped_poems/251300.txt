It was as hot as what
stars must feel like
so far away, certainlyÂ 
there, inside me.

I took it in my hands,
put it where it should be
in the wet softness
where my heart sits.

Ugly things came
to threaten me, to say
I had lost the last lock
holding me to truth.

That was not true,
because old truths
were now lies, I saw
families as human.

I found the goodness
in what is not perfect,
and a new perfection
in what is not good.

This happened in
a new home twelve
time zones away, as
the world collapsed.

in a clitter clatter
like a busy kitchen,
the universe forming
now inside all of me.

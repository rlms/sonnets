Bastard, the other boys teased him,
till Phaethon unleashed the steeds 
of Armageddon. He couldn't hold 
their reins. Driving the sun too close 
to earth, the boy withered rivers, 
torched Eucalyptus groves, until the hills 
burst into flame, and the people's blood 
boiled through the skin. Ethiopia,
land of   burnt faces. In a boy's rage 
for a name, the myth of race begins.

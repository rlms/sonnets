The release of water in the base
so controlled that the surface tension,
tabletop of stability, a mirror, 
remains unbroken. Moisture seeps 
down polished basalt sides.

This is how I grieve, barely 
enough to dampen river stones, 
until fibers in my husband's 
tweed jacket brush my fingers 
as I fold it into a box. How close 
the whirlpool under my feet.

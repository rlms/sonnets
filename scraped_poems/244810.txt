Our shadows bring them from the shadows: 
a yolk-yellow one with a navy pattern 
like a Japanese woodblock print of fish scales. 
A fat 18-karat one splashed with gaudy purple 
and a patch of gray. One with a gold head,
a body skim-milk-white, trailing ventral fins 
like half-folded fans of lace. 
A poppy-red, faintly disheveled one, 
and one, compact, all indigo in faint green water. 
They wear comical whiskers and gather beneath us 
as we lean on the cement railing
in indecisive late-December light, 
and because we do not feed them, they pass, 
then they loop and circle back. Loop and circle. Loop. 
“Look,” you say, “beneath them.” Beneath them, 
like a subplot or a motive, is a school 
of uniformly dark ones, smaller, unadorned, 
perhaps another species, living in the shadow 
of the gold, purple, yellow, indigo, and white, 
seeking the mired roots and dusky grasses, 
unliveried, the quieter beneath the quiet.

The boy and the girl were mostly gesture,
a clouded outline, the pencil lifting, lowering
to get at the idea of childhood, not the sour milk
and scraped knee of it. Her skirt was a swoop
of ink, his hand invisible in an undrawn pocket.
Circles make up the majority of the face. We are all circles
and planar suggestion. Ifâ€Š the girl wants to be a horse
she need only walk into the outline of one
and line up her body with the chest. We'll fill in
the rest, and before you know it, she's a natural.
Who will ride her? The boy doesn't know how.
He has a hankering to sketch in a saddle.
When she tosses her head, he mocks up a bridle.
He mocks her. A bridle for a bride, he says,
which doesn't seem like what little boys say,
but he wasn't so little, and she didn't run away.

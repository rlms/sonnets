We could wipe away a fly,
Drink, and order that yellow 
Thing behind the glass, peach 
Or sweet bread. Sunlight
Is catching on a fork,
Toothy wink from a star.
The fan is busy, the waiter is busy, 
And today, in this café
Of two dollars and fifty
Cents, we're so important 
Dogs are shaking our hands. 
“Welcome, turistas,” they say, 
Or might say if they could 
Roll their Rs. Where we sit 
It's three o'clock, and
Across the room, where
Old men are playing dominos 
It's maybe later, it's maybe 
Peru under their hats.
There are toads in this place
sullen guards by the door
And the bartender is just another 
Uncle fooling with the radio. 
“A little to the left,”
I shout, and he dials left, 
Then right, until it's German 
Polkas, accordions by the sea. 
The toads move a little. 
An old man clicks a domino. 
Omar, my gypsy friend, puts in
“Love is chasing me up my sleeve.”
I salute him, he salutes me, 
And together we're so drunk 
We're making sense. Little 
By little, with rum the color
Of a woman's arm, we're seeing things
Of a dancer, no two,
Make that three with one chair. 
And that manthe old one 
Over thereis so blurry 
He thinks he's flying.

It's the way they cannot understand the window 
they buzz and buzz against, the bees that take 
a wrong turn at my door and end up thus 
in a drift at first of almost idle curiosity, 
cruising the room until they find themselves 
smack up against it and they cannot fathom how 
the air has hardened and the world they know 
with their eyes keeps out of reach as, stuck there 
with all they want just in front of them, they must 
fling their bodies against the one unalterable law 
of things—this fact of glass—and can only go on 
making the sound that tethers their electric
fury to what's impossible, feeling the sting in it.

This boy lying face down
 in my sleep pushes around jars of jelly,
 waking me the night he is found

 so I can drag him from the wet ground
 and clean his blackened belly,
 this boy lying face down

 who is somehow bound
 to me, this hunted herdsman, refugee
 waking me the night he is found.

 Am I to dress him in an open gown,
 bless the holes in his chest with tea
 leaves? This boy lying face down,

 permeating even the simplest sound,
 with the crack in the door he slowly
 cries, waking me the night he is found,

 lips parted to my blue-black ground,
 whispering red vetch inside me,
 this slender boy lying down,
 waking me the night he is found.

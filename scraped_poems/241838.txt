As for her, the circumstances must be ordinary
And so the return. Door unlocked. The path mowed 
Right to the oiled gate; the pasture 

Cleared of stone and alder. All untouched
Enough to enter. The man or woman 
Off down the valley or working above

Treeline. No other sound but a few strays 
Hurrying through the dusk as if the end
Will begin, certain and with nothing

More to say. She does not know she does not know. 
Having come back to find her kind
And none being left she took herself up 

Into a tree unclear what to do next save only
Sing the song she wanted sung back to her.

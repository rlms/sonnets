Katie kissed me!
Yuck, it's true!
My face took on a greenish hue!
My knees, like jelly, started shaking!
Then my stomach started quaking!
Slobber slithered down my cheek!
My consciousness was growing weak!
My ears were ringing, my head was spinning!
But, all the while Kate was grinning!
My heart was pounding through my shirt!
My tongue felt like I just ate dirt!
Though you may think I've lost my brain!
I wished she'd kiss me once again!

It wasn't until we got the Christmas tree 
into the house and up on the stand 
that our daughter discovered a small bird's nest 
tucked among its needled branches.

Amazing, that the nest had made it 
all the way from Nova Scotia on a truck
mashed together with hundreds of other trees 
without being dislodged or crushed.
Â 
And now it made the tree feel wilder, 
a balsam fir growing in our living room, 
as though at any moment a bird might flutter 
through the house and return to the nest.

And yet, because we'd brought the tree indoors, 
we'd turned the nest into the first ornament. 
So we wound the tree with strings of lights, 
draped it with strands of red beads,

and added the other ornaments, then dropped 
two small brass bells into the nest, like eggs 
containing music, and hung a painted goldfinch 
from the branch above, as if to keep them warm.

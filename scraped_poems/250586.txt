at my kitchen sink, the bathroom upstairs
 clogged with family from out of town
 spending the night after the wake 
and the after—wake—cold beverages
 have been consumed and comfort food,
 leftovers bulging both the fridge 
and the mini-fridge. In our fifties, both
 half-asleep half-awake, we face each
 other. My sister's smile foams white 
down her chin at the end of a day 
on which no one has smiled. We laugh. 
We may never brush our teeth together again. 
No mirror down here to see our haggard faces. 
We rinse, we spit. As we were taught.

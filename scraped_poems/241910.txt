I am a daughter and a sister. 
I wonder when I will die. 
I hear the warm weather coming. 
I see stars in the day. 
I want to learn my whole ballet dance. 
I am a daughter and a sister. 

I pretend to be a teacher at home. 
I feel like I am a teacher. 
I touch hands that are growing. 
I worry that I will never change. 
I cry when something or someone dies. 
I am a daughter and a sister. 

I understand that teachers work hard for students. 
I say that I don't like bullies. 
I dream about me not moving while trying really hard to run. 
I try to become a good friend. 
I hope that there is no more dying or killing. 
I am a daughter and a sister.

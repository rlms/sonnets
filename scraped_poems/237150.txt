the absence was there before the meeting    the radical of
presence    and absence does not return with death's chance-
encounter, as in the old duality, life or death, wherein
the transcendence of the one translates the other into an everness
we do not meet in heaven, that outward of hell and death's
beauty    it is a bright and terrible disk

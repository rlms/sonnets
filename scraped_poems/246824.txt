We're writing our names with sizzles of light 
to celebrate the fourth. I use the loops of cursive, 
make a big B like the sloping hills on the west side 
of the lake. The rest, little a, r, one small b, 
spit and fizz as they scratch the night. On the side 
of the shack where we bought them, a handmade sign: 
Trailer Full of Sparkles Ahead, and I imagine crazy 
chrysanthemums, wheels of fire, glitter bouncing 
off metal walls. Here, we keep tracing in tiny 
pyrotechnics the letters we were given at birth, 
branding them on the air. And though my mother's 
name has been erased now, I write it, too: 
a big swooping I, a hissing s, an a that sighs 
like her last breath, and then I ring 
belle, belle, belle in the sulphuric smoky dark.

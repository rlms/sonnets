Whence shall come the flaming god to warm my sister's bed?  And what she-torrent shall quench my brother's fire?  And who is the woman that shall command my heart?   In the stillness of the night my sister murmurs in her sleep the fire-god's unknown name, and my brother calls afar upon the cool and distant goddess.  But upon whom I call in my sleep I know not.                                              *        *         *   Here I sit between my brother the mountain and my sister the sea.

There's a black bear 
in the apple tree 
and he won't come down. 
I can hear him panting, 
like an athlete.
 I can smell the stink 
of his body. 

Come down, black bear. 
Can you hear me? 

The mind is the most interesting thing to me; 
like the sudden death of the sun, 
it seems implausible that darkness will swallow it 
or that anything is lost forever there, 
like a black bear in a fruit tree,
 gulping up sour apples 
with dry sucking sounds, 

or like us at the pier, somber and tired, 
making food from sunlight, 
you saying a word, me saying a word, trying hard, 
though things were disintegrating. 
Still, I wanted you, 
your lips on my neck, 
your postmodern sexuality. 
Forlorn and anonymous: 
I didn't want to be that. I could hear 
the great barking monsters of the lower waters 
calling me forward. 

You see, my mind takes me far, 
but my heart dreams of return. 
Black bear, 
with pale-pink tongue 
at the center of his face, 
is turning his head,
 like the face of Christ from life. 
Shaking the apple boughs, 
he is stronger than I am 
and seems so free of passionâ€” 
no fear, no pain, no tenderness. I want to be that. 

Come down, black bear, 
I want to learn the faith of the indifferent.

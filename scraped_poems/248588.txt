Melt the fat around the heart;
Leave only muscle.

For us
Spectators

Leave
Only muscle;

Only trim the fat
To depth.

And, even if you
Nick the heart,

If you tear it
Or scratch it,

If you slice a petal off it,
Don't sweat it.

Be mindful only
That you leave the muscle

Clean,
Sheared of â€Šfat.

Or you can
Char the heart,

Melt down the fat,
Then eat it

With fucking
Fava beans.

Whatever you do,
Be sure

To leave the heart
Muscled: thick and delicious.

For we, citizens, have come
To both see and to be

The god and the heart;
We have come to become

The horns of the heart
Splintered into

Their plumpest sections.

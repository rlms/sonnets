It came with those scratches
 from all their belt buckles, 

palm-dark with their sweat 
like the stock of a gun: 

an arc of pickmarks cut 
clear through the lacquer 

where all the players before me
 once strummedâ€”once 

thumbed these same latches 
where it sleeps in green velvet. 

Once sang, as I sing, the old songs. 
There's no end, there's no end 

to this world, everlasting. 
We crumble to dust in its arms.

It was her first time coming home from college.
She headed downtown for a drink or two.
Her girlfriend went home early. That was Christmas. 
Now, under sapling pine trees in the clearing,
snowdrops are coming back to their old places.
They had been gone a lifetime. Now they stand,
poised like a choir on the verge of singing: 
Nature is just. There's nothing left to fear.
The worst thing that can happen happened here.

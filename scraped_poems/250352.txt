Those notes are fetching 
when they touch the ear. 
It's true, there are more tears 
in sand than water. 
"Come out and play," 
the song's refrain
 in my head, my sawdust showing.
 My heart, your eyes
 is what the day made.

There, the notes, the song, 
the besidedness to live 
on Saturday, to walk out, 
wanted to, right out the frame. 
The sadness, gas pumps, 
sunshine on oil, 
that crow overhead 
destroys the picture. 
Everything faking it so badly.

What's so wrong about the real,
 so off with clarity,
 dumbfuck, shirttail-hanging 
scatter-brained word.
 Shattered-pane world?

The whir of the camera inside pictures
but we want the voice to lift,
don't we, across the mini-plaza
to where? How about
pulling taffy for a living
or a rabbit from one ideal-ology
to another. That's the trick
isn't it, parallel lives?

You know, here a dumpster 
there a Dane. On the street
 I see birds, bricks, clouds 
I see a friend getting into her car
 I see myself in the puddle I see. 
And even if we pray to remain 
unabated, a minor chord 
can sometimes reconnoiter 
the most distant thoughts 
camouflaged in lace and literature.

O western wind let's not 
decorate the light with roseate diadems, 
plumbago shadows in the rushes. 
Haven't we heard enough 
from the birds, their annual trips 
and cross-talk? Listen. 
The arc of a rocket
 is louder than a rainbow.

Hmong Hunter Charged with 6 MurdersIs Said to Be a Shaman —new york times
If a tree falls in a forest, 
does it make a sound?

If a rifle fires a shot in the woods, 
whose body first hits the ground?

If a group of angry hunters 
surrounds, curses at, and accosts you 
for wandering onto their land

If you apologize for being lost,
inform you saw no posted signs, swallow
their chinks this and gooks taking over that;
are walking away over mud and fallen leaves when a loud
crack far behind you kicks up black earth

If your father was conscripted to fight
on the side of the United States
for the cia during the war in Vietnam

If he, your mother, you—the oldest son—
and all your younger siblings were later abandoned
in the hills of Laos as targets for genocide by the Viet Cong

If after five years in a Thai refugee camp, 
you come to this land as a teen, a casualty 
of history and time, then receive three years 
of training to become a sharpshooter 
in the u.s. military

If you spent your adolescence watching blacks, 
Asians, Latinos, and whites watching one 
another watch each other for weakness and flaws

If, after this first blast, you wheel 
around in a bright orange vest; glimpse 
in that split second an angry, possibly 
inebriated man lowering or resighting his rifle

If, in that icy moment, you recall 
the Native friend you used to collect cans with; 
once watched his three-hundred-pound father 
unload himself from a Chevy Impala and chase 
the boy down University with a ball-peen hammer

If, of your own children, your quietest 
son lately lacks the wherewithal at school 
to defend himself; and your oldest daughter 
has always been for some inexplicable reason 
ashamed of you

If hunting for you is not just a sport;
never a time to drink beers
with friends in a cabin, but rather
is a factor in considering your family's winter protein consumption

If you believe in God, but not the good in everyone

If you hate to think about this shit, because
why the fuck is it always on you
to preprove your loyalty and innocence?

If—frightened for your life and
the livelihood of your immediate and extended
family—in that split second, you reel
and train your own gun back at the far face
of that vapory barrel now aiming at your own

If, yes, you are sometimes angry and so look forward
to escaping your truck driver's life on certain
designated dates, on certain designated
lands, not always clearly demarcated, but always clearly stolen
from the ancestors of fat drunk red men
so confused they chase their own firey songs
in the form of their sons

Stolen from generations of skewed black backs, 
hunched your whole life on street corners laughing 
and picking their bones

Stolen from the paychecks of your brown coworker 
social security ghosts

Stolen like your own people 
from mountains in one land 
only to be resettled and resented here 
in projects and tenements

If you barely finished high school, but you know
from all you've ever seen of this system
Might Makes Right,
and excuses, treaties, and cover-ups
appear the only true code inscribed on most white men's souls

If, after such slurs, pushes, and threats in these woods
it is now also on you to assess
if that far rifle still locked on your face
just issued a mistake, a warning
shot, or murderous attempt—

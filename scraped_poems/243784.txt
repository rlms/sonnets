I have one good memory—a total 

Eclipse of the sun—when out of brilliance 

Dusk came swiftly and on the whole 

At seven years it felt good on a summer afternoon 

To be outrun by a horse from another century—

The next morning I washed up 

On land like a pod of seals 

Struck with a longing for dark at noon—

If the cessation of feeling is temporary

It resembles sleep—if permanent, it resembles

A little ice age—and the end of some 

Crewelwork by a mother who put honey

Into my hands so the bees would love me.

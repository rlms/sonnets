For Burn Construction Company
When you were building the i-10 bypass, 
one of   your dozers, moving earth 
at the center of a great pit, 
slipped its thick blade beneath 
the water table, slicing into the earth's 
wet palm, and the silt moistened 
beneath the huge thing's tires, and the crew 
was sent home for the day. 
Next morning, water filled the pit. 
Nothing anyone could do to stop it coming. 
It was a revelation: kidney-shaped, deep 
green, there between the interstate 
and the sewage treatment plant. 
When nothing else worked, you called it 
a lake and opened it to the public. 
And we were the public.

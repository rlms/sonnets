Nothing to tell why I cannot write 
in re Nobody; nobody to narrate this 
latter acknowledgement: the self that counts 
words to a line, accountable survivor 
pain-wedged, pinioned in the cleft trunk, 
less petty than a sprite, poisonous as Ariel 
to Prospero's own knowledge. In my room 
a vase of peacock feathers. I will attempt 
to describe them, as if for evidence 
on which a life depends. Except for the eyes 
they are threadbare, the threads hanging 
as from a luminate tough weed in February. 
But those eyesâ€”like a Greek letter, 
omega, fossiled in an Indian shawl; 
like a shaved cross section of living tissue, 
the edge metallic blue, the core of jet, 
the white of the eye in fact closer to beige, 
the whole encircled with a black-fringed green. 
The peacock roosts alone on a Scots pine 
at the garden end, in blustery twilight 
his lambent cloak stark as a warlock's cape, 
the maharajah-bird that scavenges 
close by the stone-troughed, stone-terraced, stone-ensurfed 
Suffolk shoreline; at times displays his scream.

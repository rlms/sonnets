We were young and it was an accomplishment
to have a body. No one said this. No one
said much beyond “throw me that sky” or 
“can the lake sleep over?” The lake could not. 
The lake was sent home and I ate too many 
beets, went around with beet-blood tongue 
worrying about my draft card-burning brother 
going to war. Other brothers became holes 
at first base at war, then a few holes 
Harleying back from war in their always 
it seemed green jackets with pockets galore 
and flaps for I wondered bullets, I wondered 
how to worship these giants. None of them 
wanted to talk to me or anyone it seemed 
but the river or certain un-helmeted curves 
at high speed, I had my body 
and flung it over branches and fences 
toward my coming sullenness as the gravity 
of girls' hips began and my brother 
marched off to march against the war. 
I watched different masses of bodies on tv, 
people saying no to the jungle with grenades 
and people saying no to the grenades with signs 
and my father saying no to all of them 
with the grinding of his teeth he spoke with. 
I'd pedal after the nos up and down a hill 
like it was somehow a rosary, somehow my body 
was a prayer I could chant by letting it loose 
with others like me milling around 
the everything below five feet tall 
that was ours, the everything below 
the adult line of sight that was ours 
to hold as long as we could: a year, 
a summer. Until the quarterback came back 
without . . . well, without. When the next Adonis 
stepped up to throw the bomb.

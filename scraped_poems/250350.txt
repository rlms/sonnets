I guess these trailers lined up in the lot off the highway will do.
I guess that crooked eucalyptus tree also.
I guess this highway will have to do and the cars
     and the people in them on their way.
 The present is always coming up to us, surrounding us. 
It's hard to imagine atoms, hard to imagine
     hydrogen & oxygen binding, it'll have to do. 
This sky with its macular clouds also
     and that electric tower to the left, one line broken free.

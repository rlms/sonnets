on bags of it.

a summer house.

a credit card
for your 5th birthday. 
bet you played
with bills for toys.
bet you chew 
them up 
for dinner.
bet you spit 
your black out 
like tobacco
that's why you talk so
bet you listen to green day.
bet you ain't never heard of al.
bet your daddy wears a robe
around the house.
bet his hands are soft as a frog's belly.
bet your house is on a hill.
bet the grass is freshly cut.
bet you feel like a princess.
bet the police protect your house.
bet you know their first names. 
bet your house has a hundred rooms.
bet a black lady comes to clean them.

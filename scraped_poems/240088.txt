Brimming the trees with song
they flood July, spill over into
August pulsing lovecries,
cicadas hereâ€”one that 
our cat brought me lay, legs folded
neatly, on clear wings as on a shroud, green
and white, fizzing now and then, 
but when I threw it spread
wings and zagged in a wide curve into
the sweetgum tree where presently
its dry buzzsaw whined for some
significant other to auger down
into dark dense earth and gnaw at 
the roots of things,
sans eyes, sans wings, sans
song for seventeen years or so.

As daylight sharpens, deer slip back
into the woods. I wonder what a deer,
when danger grows too bright,
makes of a world whose darker,
truer memories in ear
and nose must solve the dazzle of
our alien eyes, more surgical
at stripping off its cover, at masking selves
as downwind leaves.
I've read somewhere the claim, by computer people,
that pain cannot be felt
until self-consciousness
has been achieved, and they had programmed in
that level, so they said, of artificial pain.

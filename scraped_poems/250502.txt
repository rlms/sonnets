The Â pioneers and the indians 
disagree about a lot of things
 for example, the pioneer says that
 when you meet a bear in the woods 
you should yell at him and if that 
doesn't work, you should fell him
 The indians say that you should 
whisper to him softly and call him by 
loving nicknames 
No one's bothered to ask the bear 
what he thinks

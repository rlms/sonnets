Is it some turn of wind 
that funnels them all down at once, or 
is it their own voices netting 
to bring them in—the roll and churr 
of hundreds searing through river light 
and cliff dust, each to its precise 
mud nest on the face 
none of our own isolate 
groping, wishing need could be sent 
so unerringly to solace. But 
this silk-skein flashing is like heaven 
brought down: not to meet ground 
or water—to enter 
the riven earth and disappear.

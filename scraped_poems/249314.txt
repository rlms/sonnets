Like nearly all women under sixty she would have deftly 
avoided meeting the eyes of an unknown manâ€”

but occasionally an exception happens by chance 
and her unconscious skill at avoidance gets instantly 
replaced by a human generosity which is either 
inherently feminine or gender-trained, as you please;

she glanced at me exactly when I glanced at her 
in the store at the mall and so she gave me 
that momentary slight smile which implies

Though many men are dangerous, and I do not intend
to suggest the slightest likelihood that you and I will
meet or talk, much less make love and
much less together conceive a sweet helpless child,
still our eyes have just met and in this there is
an undeniable contact between your humanity and mine
and you are probably coping with some difficulties
of masculine humanity while I cope with those
of feminine humanity; and so I wish you well.

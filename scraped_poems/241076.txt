It's like I thought it would be.
 Absolute silence.
 Just me and my poem.
 But,
 as I stand onstage
 preparing to start,
 I realize the audience is quiet
 because they want to hear me. 
 Silence isn't scary.
 It's like Mr. Carey said,
 silence is my chance.
 And so I speak,
 slowly
 and clearly,
 and I don't see 
 the faces in front of me.
 I see the images of my poem,
 and I think only of what I'm saying
 and how much it means to me.
 My voice grows stronger
 and I don't have to struggle
 to remember the words.
 Â 
 I know them
 because I wrote them.

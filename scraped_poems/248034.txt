Moving forward
or back? Which way

am I? I wake grasping

your nightgown.
I am still

there. In the haze of faces

burning. Arch
of spreading

flame, black-haired girl

in saddle shoes
and plaid skirt, knee-deep

in a yard of violets.

Her father, in clogs, pounding a path
home, balancing

buckets of carp

on a bamboo pole.
Daughter, father, splash

of carp, magenta rows,

white light's flashbulb zing
fades as I cling

to silk's edge, slats

of ribs
a bridge I take

to your belly's bulge.

My pollen inside you, nubs
of arms and legs, hands with fingers

petaling. Vase of roses on the night stand.

Your gold ring engraved
with my initials. The father, feet

from the gate, his daughter

kneeling with shears,
pruning flowerbeds.

Sealed in sheets,
Â 
I draw close
to your body,

place my ear against flesh,

listen to the rhythmic thumping
inside water.

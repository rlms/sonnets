They are skimming the lake with wooden hooks. 
Where the oak throws its handful of shadows 
Children are gathering fireflies. 
I wait in the deep olive flux 
As their cries ricochet out of the dark. 
Lights spear the water. I hear the oak speak. 

It foists its mouthful of sibilants 
On a sky involved with a stillborn moon, 
On the stock-still cottages. I lean 
Into the dark. On tiny splints, 
One trellised rose is folding back 
Its shawls. The beacon strikes the lake. 

Rowboats bob on the thick dark 
Over my head. My fingers wave 
Goodbye, remember me. I love 
This cold, these captive stars. I shake 
My blanket of shadows. I breathe in: 
Dark replenishes my two wineskins. 

My eyes are huge, two washed-out mollusks. 
Oars fall, a shower of violet spray. 
When will my hosts deliver me, 
Tearing me with their wooden hooks? 
Lights flicker where my live heart kicked. 
I taste pine gum, they have me hooked. 

They reel me in, a displaced anchor. 
The cygnets scatter. I rise, I nod, 
Wrapped in a jacket of dark weed. 
I dangle, I am growing pure, 
I fester on this wooden prong. 
An angry nail is in my tongue.

Oh, but it is dirty! 
—this little filling station, 
oil-soaked, oil-permeated 
to a disturbing, over-all 
black translucency. 
Be careful with that match! 

Father wears a dirty, 
oil-soaked monkey suit 
that cuts him under the arms, 
and several quick and saucy 
and greasy sons assist him 
(it's a family filling station), 
all quite thoroughly dirty. 

Do they live in the station? 
It has a cement porch 
behind the pumps, and on it 
a set of crushed and grease- 
impregnated wickerwork; 
on the wicker sofa 
a dirty dog, quite comfy. 

Some comic books provide 
the only note of color— 
of certain color. They lie 
upon a big dim doily 
draping a taboret 
(part of the set), beside 
a big hirsute begonia. 

Why the extraneous plant? 
Why the taboret? 
Why, oh why, the doily? 
(Embroidered in daisy stitch 
with marguerites, I think, 
and heavy with gray crochet.) 

Somebody embroidered the doily. 
Somebody waters the plant, 
or oils it, maybe. Somebody 
arranges the rows of cans 
so that they softly say: 
esso—so—so—so 
to high-strung automobiles. 
Somebody loves us all.

I did not come here to sing a blues. 
 Lately, I open my mouth 
  
 & out comes marigolds, yellow plums. 
 I came to make the sky a garden.
  
 Give me rain or give me honey, dear lord. 
 The sky has given us no water this year.
  
 I ride my bike to a boy, when I get there 
 what we make will not be beautiful
  
 or love at all, but it will be deserved. 
 I've started seeking men to wet the harvest. 
  
 Come, tonight I declare we must move
 instead of pray. Tonight, east of here,
 two boys, one dressed in what could be blood
  
 & one dressed in what could be blood
 before the wound, meet & mean mug
  
 & God, tonight, let them dance! Tonight,
 the bullet does not exist. Tonight, the police
  
 have turned to their God for forgiveness.
 Tonight, we bury nothing, we serve a God
  
 with no need for shovels, we serve a God
 with a bad hip & a brother in prison.
  
 Tonight, let every man be his own lord.
 Let wherever two people stand be a reunion 
  
 of ancient lights. Let's waste the moon's marble glow
 shouting our names to the stars until we are
  
 the stars. O, precious God! O, sweet black town!
 I am drunk & I thirst. When I get to the boy
  
 who lets me practice hunger with him
 I will not give him the name of your newest ghost
  
 I will give him my body & what he does with it
 is none of my business, but I will say look,
  
 I made it a whole day, still, no rain
 still, I am without exit wound
  
 & he will say Tonight, I want to take you
 how the police do, unarmed & sudden
  
 & tonight, when we dream, we dream of dancing
 in a city slowly becoming ash.

'And all her silken flanks with garlands drest'—
 But we are coming to the sacrifice. 
 Must those flowers who are not yet gone West? 
 May those flowers who live with death and lice? 
 This must be the floweriest place 
 That earth allows; the queenly face 
 Of the proud mansion borrows grace for grace 
 Spite of those brute guns lowing at the skies. 

 Bold great daisies' golden lights, 
 Bubbling roses' pinks and whites—
 Such a gay carpet! poppies by the million; 
 Such damask! such vermilion! 
 But if you ask me, mate, the choice of colour 
 Is scarcely right; this red should have been duller.

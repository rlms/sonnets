A lot of the painting here is painting over.
Can everyone at the back hear over everyone?
Everyone is a blast of light seeping across the film.
All day high toothy windows whiten in flashlight.

We are much like we were: five times a day.
Things don't change that much in five centuries.
For ten centuries before it was faces.
Those were faces, yes. They were angels.

The gold mosaic is as fine as an angel's velvet wing.
The Christian building is spongy yellow, ochre, gold.

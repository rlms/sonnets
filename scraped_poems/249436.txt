Loot my point of view, 
                                               hove my heart 
                free from its hived booth 
though I know your smoke,
                                            its black blossom, 
is a substance I'll never become:
                              colors 
              of plaster and grass I've prepped
 flawlessly, rivers I've whittled thin. 

It's a personal matter to me, the wind.
 But let it be our cathedral feeling: 
                                                              a sculpture 
of ash 
                               dragging its robe over 
the hills because of us, 
                                             because of me. 
Yellow is hurried, 
                              but red moves like a swarm
               through toothpick homes, 
               pans over roofs, 
                             where the ethos we child
                                             from the ground 
will blacken to ruin. 
                                                           Let's glory 
              this roughened nap
 of landscape, 
                           this parched Arcadia, 
with one nude-struck match and a breeze.

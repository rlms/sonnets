                                      when I beheld a fire win out against a hemisphere of shadows.                           —Inferno, Dante (tr. by Allen Mandelbaum)
If I could hold a fire against
a hemisphere of shadows, hold it
close, not so that damage
finds my hands, but so fire scatters
galvanizing strands, my pupils
responsive to the flames' unbridled 
tutelage as they tell me
nothing but these little jumps
out of your definitions, small
or large or leaping, sinking, slumped

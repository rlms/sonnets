Colonel Cold strode up the Line
    (tabs of rime and spurs of ice);
stiffened all that met his glare:
    horses, men and lice.

Visited a forward post,
    left them burning, ear to foot;
fingers stuck to biting steel,
    toes to frozen boot.

Stalked on into No Man's Land,
    turned the wire to fleecy wool,
iron stakes to sugar sticks
    snapping at a pull.

Those who watched with hoary eyes
    saw two figures gleaming there;
Hauptmann Kälte, colonel old,
    gaunt in the grey air.

Stiffly, tinkling spurs they moved,
    glassy-eyed, with glinting heel
stabbing those who lingered there
    torn by screaming steel.

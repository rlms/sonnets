When I feel the old hunger coming on, 
I think of my two great-aunts, 
A farmer's daughters, 
Speaking into the dusk in North Dakota. 
I imagine the dark baron 
Riding out of their mouths, 
Thick-skinned and girded 
Against disaster, swathed 
In cuirass and chainmail and a curse. 
My hunger was theirs 
Too long ago. It swims in my blood, 
Groping for a foothold. 
It is the dark I thrust my tongue against, 
The wine and the delicate symphony 
That makes my head tick so exquisitely 
Tonight. My ladies, 
My dusky girls, I see you 
With your bustles puffed up like life preservers, 
Your needlepoint rose garden, 
Your George Eliot coiffures, 
Your flounces gathered like an 1890s valentine. 
You both took heroin. 
Your father never noticed. 
You sprinkled it in your oatmeal, 
Embroidered doilies with it, 
Ate it like a last supper 
At midnight. I know what you meant. 
There was always the hunger, 
The death of small things 
Somewhere in your body, 
The children that would never 
Take place in either of you. 
You were a garden of lost letters. 
A lust inhabited your veins. 
My addicts, 
The village spoke of you. 
Under your parasols, two rose windows, 
The world swam with color. 
Riding the monotonous hills at daybreak, 
You escaped the indecisions 
Your blood has handed down 
To me. You rode your father's spotted horses 
As if they might have ferried you 
Over an edge, a dark mouth in the distance. 
I see you ride the black hills of my mind, 
Sidesaddle, gowned in lemon silk, 
Galloping 
In your laced-up flesh, completely unaware 
Of something I inherited, 
The doubt, 
The fear, 
The needle point of speech, 
The hunger you passed down that I 
Possess.

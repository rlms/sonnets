living in actual ass under the stars Josie's experiment

easy access to parking and bushes

the first few times I feel awful flattened myself against the wall

easy access to bulk movements of air

dear souls “open themselves up, enraptured, to the essence of all things”

marshmallow chimes blown on by a flamey wind

we're made of the same stuff you and I matches benzene drop zones

you see this wound in my thigh a brief history of Vietfly

I say screw the bag lady who called me prince and said I did nothing for
      my people

what does a spider feel in moonlight?

marriage riding its dark horse

a child I tried to climb the black cast iron vine of my mother's sewing
       machine to learn how to sing at the school of the silver wheel but
       thread-chatter got in the way bunch-talk the needle stabbed mama's
       finger good we called it off

pagoda of dirty dishes in the sink she threatens to kill me she's upset

I say the sea is a warning full and prompt

the wave-shovels cannot pick up the dead duck fucking waves hats off
      to the dead duck

how many reels exhaust the image history of the person

it would be lovely to heal in a little muck called never mind

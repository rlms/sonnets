In one who doesn't speak the story petrifies,
gets stumbled over, causes hurt. Then,

says the man who should know about the past, then 
is a word you need to learn now. Then 

lived lives had has
a name a body, sacrificial hands 

so god might help us. Feel with your hands and feet 
back along these countless steps and hear

the incessant bloodrush, its dark red

presence. That was what the man insisted, 
in so many words, pointing to the ornate

temple corridor, an altar 
conjured at its vanishing point.

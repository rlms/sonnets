Because in medieval Italian it meant “room” 
I tied the curtains at their elbows with 
what could have been honor cords or worse 
yet, a belt from the 60s, so hideous were the 
tassels that were dancing a little tarantella 
after I had propped the windows and the wind 
had carried in the song the rubbing trees 
were making, without any accompaniment, 
mind you, from a tambourine, although the bells 
of   the occasional sleigh played that part, 
while I waited for the vixen and their shameless 
yelping to follow the music and the cold 
and the night inside where I sat half man, 
half snow, to investigate my squeaking 
pencil and the flapping of the bird-white page 
I couldn't seem to catch in those years when I 
lugged around a frozen heart and was infatuated 
with whiteness, since I had read somewhere it was 
the absence of color, which could not be true 
since I had once loved a pure white duck with 
a white bill and feet and I had even torn its white 
flesh with my teeth that were still then white, 
which should have been all the proof anyone needed 
to debunk our outdated theories of absence.

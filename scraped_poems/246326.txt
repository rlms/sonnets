My transgressions pile against the garden wall
(built when Rome began to weaken, scarred 

by a cannonball.) I gossiped; I snubbed 
a dinner guest. I watch until the wall writhes 

with awful feral cats fed by shrunken widows 
and the odd librarian. I've begun to be depleted 

by your absence; one of â€Šlove's worst symptoms. 
For years, I'd had the sense to hold myself apart. 

I've been here long enough to kill 
two mint plants and a lavender, 

then resurrect their better part.
I'd like to let you die on the vine. 

Not you, the You I Dream, 
who follows through on waking. 

See how the watcher sees the storm 
but doesn't get wet. Be that. 

Be what? 
Be wiser than the heart.

Tonight, away begins to go
farther away, and the dream
what do we know of the dream
metallic leaps Jackson Pollock
silvery streams Jackson Pollock
I gaze across the sea

see in the distance your walk and you
pass the Pacific, distant and blue
phallus and Moloch pace my view
on into otherness

on into otherness?
are we in the world after or before
are we or are we not magnetic force
it is apparently me you inform:

genesis woman dream that begins
tonight to go farther away
tonight to reach farther away
metallic leaps Jackson Pollock
silvery streams Jackson Pollock
on across the blue sea

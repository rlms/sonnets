out from 
under it 
and down 
the mountain 
slope it comes 
flat on its back 
white skirt 
and billowy 
petticoats 
blowing
back over 
its head, 
whiplashing 
rickety
pine sapling 
as it passes, 
bowling boulders 
left and right 
until it comes 
to a juddering 
sudden heart- 
thumping stop 
just shy 
of the little village 
in the valley far below.

They've flown south now 
 and one Great Egret fishes the pond 
 as broad-winged hawks begin their migrations, 
 kenneling on thermal currents of wind 
 off above yellowing mountains. 
 Now, snakeweed blooms along the trail choking 
 white and purple asters. A few bleeding 
 leaves fall amidst wilting greenery. Poison 
 Ivy turns red with warning. 
  
 My eighty-three-year-old mother still argues 
 with my father, twelve years dead. Their hatred 
 reverberates in a back room 
 of my head, rattling memories of my lonely childhood. 
 Their loathing for each other 
 colors all my days with pain. I loved him 
 because he loved me best, but I look like her, 
 my face and spirit tear at each other. 
 Am I the child of hate? 
  
 A wounded love sprouts like a weed 
 from watery depths, uncultivated, 
 flowers, white and purple, bloom, 
        even in these days of dying leaves. 
 Beyond winter, 
        no one grieves.

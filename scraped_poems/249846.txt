We take more than our share,
Several dozen from the star-

Flecked cove of a red maple
Pond, fins tapered like steeples,

Gill to gill in the bucket
And bilge, drawn from a thicket

Of drowned roots
Into the night's cool garrotes.

Sorrowful brothers
Choking on strange ethers,

Striving, eager, bent
Toward the sky by want:

It was not to be, this breathing,
Though not for nothing.

don't expect too much.
  
 Well I expect you to go into the
 fucking human tunnel
 I'm going.
  
 pink grimy glossed
 entabulature, welted
 and tattooed. Enfolded in
 ropy ceiling-hangings
 but it isn't a room,
  
 and bumblingly sliding
 out, little legs of 
  
 a little girl, bum on the wall/opening
  
 pink legs sticking out like a
 hermit crab's, she's coming!
  
 shudder out the little-girl
 legs with a little
 girl head mostly eyes, no ears,
 bug brain, aimless
  
 Send her to school
  
 It's cold, and where should she
 go, she will eat her
 legs with her mandibles
  
 her eyes will retract inside.
  
 Stroke her riding hood
 Settle down, little
  
 nobody will hurtcha
  
 by breaking off your little legs,
 six little legs,
 if you come.

The naked man in the caravan 
                                                       has peace of mind. He whose covering 
belongs to others is uncovered. 
                           He who has luck will have the winds 
                                                                                  blow him his firewood.
He whose trousers are made of dry grass should not warm himself at
      the fire.
He howled before going mad. 
                                                           He led the lion by the ear. 
Like the sparrow, he wanted to imitate 
                                                             the pigeon's walk but lost his own. 
Walk with sandals till you get good shoes. 
                                        Where the turban moves, there moves 
the territory. Men meet 
                           but mountains don't. Always taking out 
                                                 without giving back, even the mountains 
                  will be broken down. Penny piled on penny 
will make a heap. Only the unlucky coin 
                                 is left in the purse. As long as a human being lives 
he will learn. 
                                       Learn to shave by shaving orphans. 
He who is to be hanged can insult the Pasha. 
                                             In the house of a man who has been hanged 
don't talk of rope. 
The small donkey is the one that everybody rides. 
                                      Fish eat fish 
                                                        and he who has no might dies. 
                                                                        My belly before my children.

It's not spring yet, but I can't 
wait anymore. I get the hoe, 
pull back the snow from the old 
furrows, expose the rich dark earth. 
I bare my hand and dole out shriveled peas, 
one by one.

I see my grandmother's hand, 
doing just this, dropping peas 
into gray gumbo that clings like clay. 
This moist earth is rich and dark 
as chocolate cake.

Her hands cradle 
baby chicks; she finds kittens in the loft 
and hands them down to me, safe beside 
the ladder leading up to darkness.

I miss 
her smile, her blue eyes, her biscuits and gravy, 
but mostly her hands. 
I push a pea into the earth, 
feel her hands pushing me back. She'll come in May, 
she says, in long straight rows, 
dancing in light green dresses.

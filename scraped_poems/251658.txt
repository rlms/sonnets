boat me around gently.
whoever i'm with
i'm seeing only you.

diplomacy has wounded us.
pierced us. smashed us.
is there something
in the turning
of this river's head
that will mend our dislocations?

your eagle drives my ego.
there is ice in your thighs.

take the buoys of light
for your thighpaths whose
eyes

night has darkened.

[Étude from the Fourth Treatise of the Convivio, Chapter XXVII]

In my youth, not unstaind
and in much ignoble;   in manhood,
struggling to ring true   yet
knowing often my defection from
these graces Dante lists
proper to Man:   temperance, courage,
love, courtesy,
and loyalty.   I speak still
to sustain his meaning in my own.
And, in you, whatever I have known
of grace comes through to me.

Now, upon old age:   “Our life
has a fixt course and a simple path”

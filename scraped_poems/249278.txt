I swear that I would not go back
 To pole the glass fishpools where the rough breath lies 
That built the Earth – there, under the heavy trees 
With their bark that's full of grocer's spice, 

Not for an hour – although my heart
 Moves, thirstily, to drink the thought – would I 
Go back to run my boat
 On the brown rain that made it slippery,

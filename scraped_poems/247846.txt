A rail, buff-banded rail,
weaves among the legs
of picnickers who loll at ease
on the buttress roots of fig trees.
It queries fallen fruit
with manners so refined
as to be indeterminate,
its herringbone immaculate.
Aloof though underfoot,
the rail extracts a crust
of pie from picnic residue — 
no seediness, no trace
of table-scrap solicitude
for any human hand or face.

Bustle and caw. Recall the green heat 
rising from the new minted earth, granite

and basalt, proto-continents shuffling
and stacking the deck, first shadows flung 

from the ultraviolet haze. A fern 
uncurls from the swamp, the microscopic furnace

of replication warms the world, one 
becoming two, two four: exponential blossom. 

Lush with collision, the teacup balance 
of x and y, cells like balloons

escaping into the skyâ€”then the dumbstruck
hour, unmoored by a river,

a first fish creeps to the land to marvel
at the monstrous buds of its toes. And stars

grow feet and walk across the years, into these dozing,
ordinary days, climbing the spine's winding

stair, where crickets yawn and history spins.

Here, the brightest constellation
   is Hydra, the Water Snake, named
for the half-woman, half-reptile 

   whom Hercules slew with the help
of  Iolaus, his charioteer. Imagine
   the sound of so many heads screaming — 

the long, shrill bays of an angry woman
   times twenty — and the smell of birth, 
of all origins, that followed Hydra

   as she rose from her fetid swamp. Iolaus
was strategic, went straight for the bowels
   instead of the mouth, burned her center

before the head. When her fundament
   was reduced to ash, only then could
Hydra be silenced. Hera, enraged

   that Hercules was able to slay the creature
she had raised in order to destroy him,
   flung the corpse of the decapitated,

maimed Hydra into the sky, lest she be
   forgotten. Hydra's blood, unstoppable,
became hot gas; her screams rose 

   and fell until they were radio waves;
and her wild flailing was fixed
   into points of radiance. Hera was right

to hurl those stars here, above this bay,
   so close to where the earth is bisected,
a place where Hydra's mirror image

   glosses the water, where dense blooms
of  algae flourish on the nitrogen surface,
   thousands of wild heads and arms

devouring ammonia, cyanide, and sewage
   as fast as we can produce them,
this hydra, emblem of insatiable desire.

Of ox and luncheon tongue, six hundred pounds;
      of Wiltshire bacon, seven-tenths of a ton. 
Seventeen hundred miles they walked, and it was
      pony meat that saved them. But one biscuit, this one 
Of thousands, baked by Huntley & Palmers, a special formulation
     fortified with milk protein, survives—the men 
Long dead, and the ponies, whose lives flew through
 Bullet holes easily over the frozen labyrinth of the Fortuna Glacier,
      all gone to powder. Found a century later in the wrecked 
Larder of one of Shackleton's way stations, it remains
      perfectly nutritious, and sold at a Christie's auction 
Is worth a thousand-some sterling. We had seen God in
      His splendors; we had reached the naked soul of man, 
He wrote. And: This biscuit, said a Christie's director,
      is an object that really catches the imagination.

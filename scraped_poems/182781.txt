“I saw a friend from growing up who's been  living in L.A. for about twenty years, and I  heard him say, ‘I'm from L.A.,' and I said,  ‘No, man, you from Philly. We don't give  nobody up.'”  —Khan Jamal  jazz vibraphonist
Fish-man comes with trout and fresh crabs: 
“Live! They live crabs! They live crabs!” 
Bars called “Watutsi.” “Pony-Tail.” 

A dark green suit, a banded hat. 
The gentleman buys pig's feet and 
papaya juice. He looks like church. 

Another man, down Spruce Street, says, 
“Yeah, California's beautiful, 
but I ain't got no people there, 

so I came back. I raised a racehorse. 
Trainer says he's mean, but I say 
naw, naw. That horse just alive.” 

Which way to walk down these tree streets 
and find home cooking, boundless love? 
Double-dutching on front porches, 

men in sleeveless undershirts. 
I'm listening for the Philly sound— 
Brother            brother            brotherly love.

Why Brownlee left, and where he went,
Is a mystery even now.
For if a man should have been content
It was him; two acres of barley,
One of potatoes, four bullocks,
A milker, a slated farmhouse.
He was last seen going out to plough
On a March morning, bright and early.

By noon Brownlee was famous; 
They had found all abandoned, with 
The last rig unbroken, his pair of black 
Horses, like man and wife,
 Shifting their weight from foot to 
Foot, and gazing into the future.

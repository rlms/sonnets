Phoenix  “In Egyptian mythology, a bird  which lived for five hundred  years and then consumed itself  in fire, rising renewed from the ashes.”  —webster
The earth is a beautiful place. 
Watermirrors and things to be reflected. 
Goldenrod across the little lagoon. 

The Black Philosopher says 
“Our chains are in the keep of the Keeper 
in a labeled cabinet 
on the second shelf by the cookies, 
sonatas, the arabesques. . . . 
There's a rattle, sometimes. 
You do not hear it who mind only 
cookies and crunch them. 
You do not hear the remarkable music—‘A 
Death Song For You Before You Die.' 
If you could hear it 
you would make music too. 
The blackblues.” 




   West Madison Street. 
In “Jessie's Kitchen” 
nobody's eating Jessie's Perfect Food. 
Crazy flowers 
cry up across the sky, spreading 
and hissing This is 
it.

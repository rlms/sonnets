Softly pummeled overnight, the lower 
limbs of our Norway spruce 
flexed and the deepening snow held them. 
Windless sunlight now, so I go out 
wearing hip waders and carrying
not a fly rod but a garden hoe. I begin 
worrying the snow for the holdfast 
of a branch that's so far down 
a wren's nest floats above it like a buoy. 
I work the hoe, not chopping but cradling, 
then pull straight up. A current of air
as the needles loft their burden 
over my head. Those grace notes 
of the snowfall, crystals giving off 
copper, green, roseâ€”watching them 
I stumble over a branch, go down 
and my gloves fill with snow. Ah, I find 
my father here: I remember as a child 
how flames touched my hand the time 
I added wood to the stove in our ice-fishing 
shanty, how he plunged that hand 
through the hole into the river, teaching me 
one kind of burning can ease another. 
The branch bobs then tapers into place 
and composes itself, looking 
unchanged though all summer 
it will bring up this day from underfoot.

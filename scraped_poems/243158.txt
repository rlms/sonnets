For Arthur Russell
All that glitters isn't music.

Once, hidden in tall grass, 
I tossed fistfuls of dirt into the air:
doe after doe of leaping. 

You said it was nothing 
but a trick of the light. Gold 
curves. Gold scarves. 

Am I not your animal?

You'd wait in the orchard for hours 
to watch a deer
break from the shadows.

You said it was like lifting a cello 
out of its black case.

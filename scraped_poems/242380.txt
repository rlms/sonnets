The heat shimmer along our street 
one midsummer midafternoon, 
and wading up through it a horse's hooves, 
and each shoe raising a tongueless bell 
that tolled in the neighborhood, 
till the driver drew in the reins 
and the horse hung its head and stood.

And something in a basket thin 
as shavings (blackberries? or a ghost 
of the memory of having tasted them?) 
passing into my hands as mother paid, 
and the man got up again, 
slapping the loop from the reins, 
and was off on his trundling wagon.ï»¿

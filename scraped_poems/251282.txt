It confuses love with a wet afternoon in an emptyroom.  The  unpainted walls a reminder of how sex can resemble poverty.  Ahollow  cry.   An open mouth falling inside as you sleep.   I prepare  my heartand language with better words,  like worlds in small selves  I've built.  Everymonth,  one dollar buys me one brick.  But  how many bricks  does  it  take tobuild a house?  A stray dog barks late at night.  I can't  see him  but know he'sthere.   He   reminds   me   that  here,  dreams  have  dangerous  turns.  I  turnaround  to  no  one  naked  beside  me. I  play  it  safe  not to see the fire in myhands.  But let us be clear:  I'm no beggar.  It's  just that there are times  when the  world  is  a  sound  that  cripples  the air,  and the soul. When what seemsarranged — glazing and  strange,  like  music  played on tin cans — turns  intowilting  noise.  When  suddenly,  all  that  exists  is  a small boy trying to focuson the pain lifting a nation.  A telephone call:  He was wearing black shoes, a Calvin  Klein  T-shirt  that he  found in a hotel trash, brown slacks.  She  was wearing  one  earring  on her right ear,  one sock on her left foot, a dress the color  of sky.  She  bought him  a canne à sucre.  He pulled her close, said, Ti cherie.   And  after  they  promised  to meet  later,   she  winked  and  walked leisurely in the shade. A tremble followed. When he turned around, her bodywas one of a thousand on the streets. He ran towards her, stood by her arm,unable to see her face. The call drops. I begin to count the ways I tolerate mydry mouth. To count the glasses of water I gave away to make up for my sins.But this act does not count when we fall out of our hearts.

This isn't a great poem.
 I'm not writing this to write a great poem.
 I am writing this because I am one person.
 I am only one.
 I have a face and a front of my face.
 I have two shoulders and two hips.
 I'm living.
 I live.
 So what can I do with my face if it can't see that person's face?
 What do I tell my eyes to see?
 How do I let them know that when they see that face it is that person's wish that they not know it?
 How do I tell them we have to go back into the world where no one knows us and we don't know anyone?
 How do I tell them to stay there?
 There is nothing for them to see.
 How do I tell my hands they will never touch that person's hands?
 How do I tell my ears that when that person says my name it is only a word?
 How do I tell my lips to make that person's name another word so I can say it?
 How do I tell my neck that person cannot see it?
 How do I tell my hair that person cannot pull it?
 It is my hair.
 It is my head.
 How do I tell my teeth they will never strike that person's teeth?
 How do I tell my thighs it does not matter what they do?
 They are the tops of my legs.
 They will fall apart.
 How do I tell my back it must never wait for that person?
 That person will not hold me.
 That person does not know where I am, does not think of me.
 Does not know I have exhausted every argument against him.
 That person does not know I no longer love freedom.
 That person does not know what it means when I ask for forgiveness.
 That person does not know I beg the world to let me change.
 That person cannot see my face.
 Knows a woman with my name and she is a woman.
 Does not know the word I hide behind my words.
 Does not know this face.
 Does not know this is my face.
 Says my name and looks at this person.
 How do I tell my feet to stand here?
 How do I tell my eyes to see?
 How do I tell the voice under my voice to keep on speaking?
 How do I tell my mouth to speak?

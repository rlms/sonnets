I am tired of people
combing their hair
and dripping in gold.

Too much lacking the raw
of a natural fondness, and
I'm bloated with a craving;
pack

afewthings.


Three times I've loved ya.

I am tired of wanting you.


Of dressing myself.
Of putting myself forth
at every spoonful of
cereal
or artificial glory.


I am rabid with a consciousness,
teeming with an illness 
coagulated with thought,
BUYing your art

magazines

your red pants
your new soles.


Porn is free!
Did you know that?

Porn is free.

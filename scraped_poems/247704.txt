When no one else would listen, Saint Anthony
preached seaward, his words fishnet for the lost
souls of the heretics. Caught up in despair, we plea
to the one who will listen: Saint Anthony,
please return TÃ­a's teeth or the misplaced key 
to our bolted hopes. Patron retriever of all we've tossed 
when no one else would. Listen, Saint Anthony,
teach us to steward this world, all our netted loss.

All morning, doing the hard, root-wrestling 
work of turning a yard from the wild 
to a gardener's will, I heard a bird singing 
from a hidden, though not distant, perch;
a song of swift, syncopated syllables sounding 
like, Can you believe this, believe this, believe? 
Can you believe this, believe this, believe?

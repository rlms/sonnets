                      Griffith Park, Los AngelesEvery living heart . . . all over this broad land, will yet swell . . . , when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.                      —Abraham Lincoln
Because the body now and its organs suggest nothing
     but those pathologies in which we've been instructed,
Because the gutter's black as new blood, a Petri dish
     of piss and teeth knocked loose at the root,
Because our walking here's scared up pigeons and the air's
     thick with their disease, because, therefore, we're holding
Our breath in silent prayer, Good People of Los Angeles,
     for our immune systems, for hand sanitizer,
For swift and decisive return of the sun's irradiating
     grace, I can hardly say I even know you much
Beyond the turnstile's slick in the discount supermarket,
     the sidewalk's chewing gum and tuberculosis.
But I've been thinking of you, of your eyes darting behind

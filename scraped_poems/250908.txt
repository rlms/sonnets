It's called a port, a harbor, haven, home, 
a city on the coast of my chest opened 
for a passage into my heart—which we say
 is where emotions live—and it's embedded, 

slipped into a shallow nest of flesh, a bump, 
a lump under the skin on the right so 
the narrow street can reach the marketplace 
of the aorta, receptive to any 

incoming ship, needle, boat, barge, unloading
 its spices, crates of dates, barrels of poisons, 
Etoposide phosphate, amethyst, amaranth, 
Cisplatin, amphorae of wine and olives. 

I carry it secretly under my skin 
because it is easier. I carry 
everything under my skin, so lightly 
I barely notice, watching from the ramparts 

the dangerous rocky anchorage below 
where goods and evils, bundled together 
and tied, arrive, waiting to be unloaded 
and poured out into a welcoming country.

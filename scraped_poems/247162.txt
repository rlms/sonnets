on thoth's tits
From Sonnet 75 (“So are you to my thoughts as food to life”)


A groovy day, a fish fillet, an elf hair,
A cosmonaut, a microdot, a hoedown,
A trusty door, the finest whore on welfare,
A neocon who's keeping on the lowdown,

A purple fist, a Federalist, a sunspot,
A bird that's got a big big butt to study,
A guy named Toots, ten dumb galoots, a gunshot,
Die Fledermaus by good ol' Strauss (my buddy),

A grinning troll, a real a-hole, a smiler,
A dude who knows a gushing hose is funny,
An underdressed (no tie, no vest) John Tyler,
A sexy flirt, a cowboy shirt — oh honey!

I'll flip you for a dinosaur, my sweeties,
When Uncle Pete lets Usher eat our Wheaties.




uh huh: hi, hula tooth
From Sonnet 135 (“Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will”)


Will refried catnip addicts find a cure? 
Will daytime televangelists go broke? 
Will Algorithmic Horses go on tour? 
Will nineteen shekels buy one thin, thin Coke?

Will innovative inverts be reported? 
Will weasel-human hybrids rent a maid? 
Will hesitating oxen get aborted? 
Will analysts of real estate get laid?

Will hoochie-coochie nuns remove their mink? 
Will enemies of hotness shut it down? 
Will tame aphasic mynahs learn to think? 
Will Hi-Ho hunt the hound in Ho-Ho town?

Will Willy Loman eat a thousand ants? 
Will Willa Cather do that nasty dance?

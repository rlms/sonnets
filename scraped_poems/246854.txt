I'm playing with the devil's cock
it's like a crayon
it's like a fat burnt crayon
I'm writing a poem with it
I'm writing that down
all that rattling heat in this room
I'm using that
I'm using that tingling rattle
that light in the middle of the room
it's my host
I've always been afraid of you
scared you're god and something else
I'm afraid when you're yellow
tawny
white it's okay. Transparent cool
you don't look like home
my belly is homeless
flopping over the waist of my jeans like an omelette
there better be something about feeling fat
what there really is is a lack of emptiness
I'm aiming for that empty feeling
going to get some of that
and then I'll be back

This to be beautiful to you 
 Set against all this you know of 
 So ominous, set against it, 
Overcome, might overcome. 
 This to be beautiful, beautiful, 
 Never alone enough with God 
 Never enough among fountains 
 This be beautiful Spring blue. 
 Leaf love you for this the while 
 I am with you and the while after 
 This earth I am standing on, the 
 Herons and smaller birds possess. 
 This to be beautiful to you 
 The downward fire I spoke of 
 The eel grass, the snowy path, 
 The wide shore, the wide shore. 
 Speak of it, speak it, unceasing, all 
 These lines to the tomb, O turning tree, 
 Set against all this you know of 
 Overcome, will, overcome. 
Grave tree of the dark plowland under, 
I will will the whole time to you: 
Falling water, wave falling, dew 
Dust, horses, spirits, Spirit.

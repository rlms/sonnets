I think of the man who sat
behind my grandmother's sister
in church and told her
the percentage of Indian 
in her blood, calling it out
over the white pews.
I wonder what made
him want to count it 
like coins or a grade.
I wish I could hear him
now when I think of her
saying that all 
the Wampanoag blood
in her body would
fit in one finger,
discounting the percentage
it seemed, but why was she 
such a historian, tracing
the genealogy of the last
Wampanoag up to her own
children, typing it all on see-through
paper? Maybe like me
she felt a little self-conscious
caring about what
we're made of 
instead of simply being
satisfied dressing
our bodies and driving
them around. 
Maybe she felt shy
for loving someone
she'd never met, I mean
I do. I think of the knife 
cutting into flesh 
and the fork carrying it

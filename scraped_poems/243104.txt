I look through glass and see a young woman 
of twenty, washing dishes, and the window 
turns into a painting. She is myself thirty years ago. 
She holds the same blue bowls and brass teapot 
I still own. I see her outline against lamplight; 
she knows only her side of the pane. The porch 
where I stand is empty. Sunlight fades. I hear 
water run in the sink as she lowers her head, 
blind to the future. She does not imagine I exist.
Â 
I step forward for a better look and she dissolves 
into lumber and paint. A gate I passed through 
to the next life loses shape. Once more I stand 
squared into the present, among maple trees
and scissor-tailed birds, in a garden, almost 
a mother to that faint, distant woman.

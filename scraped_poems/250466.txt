Here, I am blowing this little stream
of blue vapor into your parted lips.

Here, I am placing my hands on your chest
in an X while my red nails distract

the crowd of impostor lifeguards
closing in. Here is the place to raise

the tent, I can feel it in my bones.
The snake has perfected his skin, he is

ready to be lifted and passed. How
did I do it? The process was messy,

I'd rather not share it, but look, look
at us now. Lemon drops and cherry bombs.

It's the eye of the tiger, went the song
I used to sing in the basement alone.

A sleeper, they used to call it— 
four passes with the giant round saw 
and you had a crosstie, 7 inches by 9 of white oak— 
at two hundred pounds nearly twice my weight 
and ready to break finger or toe—
 
like coffin lids, those leftover slabs, 
their new-sawn faces turning gold and brown 
as my own in the hot Virginia sun, 
drying toward the winter and the woodsaw
 
and on the day of that chore 
I turned over a good, thick one 
looking for the balance point
 
and roused a three-foot copperhead, 
gold and brown like the wood, 
disdaining the shoe it muscled across,
 
each rib distinct as a needle stitching leather, 
heavy on my foot as a crosstie.

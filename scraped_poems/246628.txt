It's all of it rigged, she says, 
Bust-one-wins, Hi-striker, even the Dozer. 
It's like you think you'll score that giant panda 
for the wife except you can't, or not 
without you drop another twenty 
and then—what?—then you win 
a thumb-sized monkey or a little comb. 
She hands me five ones and then stands. 
She's worked the whole of the midway, 
she says, funnel cake to corn-dogs. 
She's worked every game 
plus half the rides, Krazy Koaster, 
Avalanche, Wing-Ding, Tilt-a-Whirl 
and if there's somebody sick she'll do 
a kiddy ride too, Li'l Choo-choo, maybe 
the Tea Cup. 
There's a collapsing soft sigh 
and she sits, opens the paper, turns a page 
and as if she were the one assigned to face forwards, 
as if it were her job to intuit the world 
and interpret the news, 
Anymore, she says, it's out of our hands, 
it's all we can do—it's not up to you. 
You see that bald bronco tearing 
tickets at the carousel? 
We worked the Bottle-drop 
and now he's mine: he's no genius 
but he loves me and he's mine. 
Things happen, she says, you 
can't take them back.

My brother wore bags over his boots
              to keep the grease & grime from his time
                           at the steel mill off the carpet & steps

he mounted, heaving each foot
               like a monster born of the grave
                            -yard shift — stiff & awkward,

his arms smeared w/dark matter,
               the lather of machine & industry
                             bathing his clothes & face in a glaze

of sweat & smoke, oil & the dirt
               of what's been done before — the work
                             of uncles & cousins who wore the same

jumpsuit, goggles & gloves to grab hold
               of cold finished bars using their backs
                             & shoulders to move the weight around

w/the help of machines, the knobs
               to control the two-ton bundles
                             held by a buckle above the heads

of hard-hatted men that could snap
               & let loose the mass of all that metal
                             meant to weld into a foundation,

a beginning to build upon
               when it was his time to work,
                            to clock in clean & leave

feeling filthy no matter the shift
               or stiffness in the bones creaking
                             like the wooden stairs he climbed

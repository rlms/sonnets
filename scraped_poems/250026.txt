This one appeared to me
 in a dream, was forgotten, 
only to reveal itself 
on the shower wall
 this morning.
It must have been the water.
     •
That one was on the full moon 
last night, clear as a bell. 
Someone projected it there.
      •
This one was on the ground, 
on crunchy pine needles. 
The moon projected it there. 
     •
I forgot about that one . . .
How was I to know
 it would be significant?
     •
Every time I see this one, 
I'm angry. It doesn't diminish, 
either, from that first time. 
     •
Oh, that one! 
To tell you the truth, 
I never actually 
saw it, but I could 
feel it as it was 
described to me
 by a blind person 
over the phone.
    •
This one I spotted 
on the back 
of someone's shirt
 in a crowd
before she disappeared. 
    •
That one evolved, 
and is still evolving, 
on that big, flat rock 
over there; something
 scraped it, scratched it, 
the heat cracked it,
 the frost coated it, 
tiny plants took root, 
sheltering insects,
 and it rained, 
and it rained, 
and by the time
 I showed up,
a butterfly had just flown off. 
     •
Not this one again. 
It makes me so sad . . .
     •
I was glad to receive
 that one as a gift. 
So glad, in fact, 
that I went and had 
some copies made. 
     •
Believe it or not, 
this one has a sound. 
Just listen.
    •
Oh, boy—that one! 
I'll never go there again. 
    •
This one often arrives 
in the smoke of incense.
     •
I tried to turn
 that one over—
 it burned my hand.
    •
This one I tried
 to discard— 
unsuccessfully, obviously.
    •
That one speaks to me 
of space, and negative space,
 of open and filled spaces, 
and the among 
that comes between. 
    •
Whereas this one 
is the opposite— 
you get the picture.
   •
Oh, my goodness— 
I've never seen 
that one before!
    •
This one, from what
I gather,
is an accident.
    •
That one, however, 
is intended.
    •
This one took some 
getting to—
 waiting for the thaw, 
for instance—
 but it was
 well worth it.
   •
That one, well,
 you can have it.
    •
Whenever this one 
comes my way, 
it's déjà vu, 
but I'm ready for it.
   •
That one is owned 
by the dentist.
   •
This one has been 
proven to be a fake, 
but I still like it. 
    •
Alas, I lost 
that one once,
 in childhood, 
and it took me 
until now to find it.
    •
If you can only have 
one, choose this one.

Pushing the seed into the ground 
isn't enough. Whatever blooms 

in this place is dumb and blind. 
Foreclosure is a one-eyed man. 

Nothing falls from a sky like this 
except a little rain, never enough rain. 

All night my wife looks down
 the neck of my guitar 

passing the bottle back and forth 
like a story she's been telling for years. 

So many baskets of hard bread. 
You take the shovel to the ground. 

The land stares back at you. 
The corn drifts towards the sky. 

You don't know what dirt is 
until you bury your first daughter.

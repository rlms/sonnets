I wondered how long I could go on 
once the rain had stopped. My nerves

were wedged like wings under a hat. 
Corncobs bobbed in boiling water. I kept

a fist in my mouth. I was strident.
The neat house curved like a draining sink.

Hot cars shined outside. Their engines 
snapped like a chamois. I never

wanted to leave. The streets were suet-thick. 
The hucksters had tinny voices. They had

swollen drums. They had gravel underfoot 
and tongues that could peel citrus.

Radios throbbed. The wet hush 
of my breath flung itself to mother.

The soft dark skin. The sweet 
curl of the arm. The hum.

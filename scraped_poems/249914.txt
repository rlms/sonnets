On the eighth day he coined the word “alone”
 and saw that it was as good as everything else. 
A yellow school bus rattled down the lane, 
a wind blew in a drainpipe, strong, mellifluous. 

I brought two empty crates to the parking lot, 
watched neighbors with briefcases and car keys. 
At noon a mailman passed by where I sat 
invisible, like a tree among trees.

 Why, why, I asked. I wanted to know why, 
but only scared a squirrel that dropped his acorn 
when my voice broke silence unexpectedly— 
a white noise in a wireless telephone. 

My club soda went flat in the bottle. With a spit 
of rain, a wind blew again from the lake.
 I raised my index finger and touched it, 
pleading, give me a break, give me a break.

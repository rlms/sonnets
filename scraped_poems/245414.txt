These brown piles
of stubble

hills

have failed.

They should be more

                       •

It should be difficult
but not impossible

to transmute
latitude

into a thought

a god could
hold.

                       •

Barred light:

dunes coming on
and on.

                       •

The eye, yes,
must move

to prevent 
blank spots

from making themselves
known.

Each night, in a space he'd make 
between waking and purpose, 
my grandfather donned his one 
suit, in our still dark house, and drove 
through Brooklyn's deserted streets 
following trolley tracks to the bakery.

There he'd change into white 
linen work clothes and cap, 
and in the absence of women, 
his hands were both loving, well 
into dawn and throughout the dayâ€” 
kneading, rolling out, shaping

each astonishing moment 
of yeasty predictability 
in that windowless world lit 
by slightly swaying naked bulbs, 
where the shadows staggered, woozy 
with the aromatic warmth of the work.

Then, the suit and drive, again. 
At our table, graced by a loaf 
that steamed when we sliced it, 
softened the butter and leavened 
the very air we'd breathe,
he'd count us blessed.

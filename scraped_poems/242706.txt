Fair season and we're tent pitching 
on holy grounds in central Illinois, 
busting through pavement with jack hammers, 
driving home a stake that will be pulled two months 
from now. One of us holds, the other presses 
down, grease shooting between cracks 
in the old hammer's worn shell 
to our hands and facesâ€”one slip and we've 
lost our toes. I'm from the warehouse, 
not the tent crew. I haven't ridden around 
in tent haulers across the nation 
popping tents here and there, but for this, 
the state fair, the warehousers are let out 
to feel important. Around us a silvered city 
has risen, white vinyl tents at full mast 
and clean for the first time in a year. It's August. 
It's the summer's dogged days when humidity 
doesn't break until midnight, an hour after 
the fair's closed down. We're piled on back 
of a flatbed with our tools, our tiredness. 
We're a monster understood best 
by Midwesterners, devouring parking lots 
and fields, our teeth stained by cigarette 
and chew, some of us not old enough, some 
too old. All of us here for the overtime.

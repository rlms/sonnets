In memory D.K., Scrovegni Chapel, Padua

“Even Duccio can't match
Giotto's stage management of great tragedy”:
Transgendered Professor Y. in leather miniskirt
paces before the screen, wood pointer
scraping saint faces, slapping 
hunched women of the Lamentation. 
Blue-gold tumult of the chapel walls. 
After-lunch lecture hall heat. 
You're in that class with me. We go on 
from there—not long. You do The Waste Land
in different voices—Come in under the shadow
of this red rock

rain on the lake 
room at the lodge 
alone in a room 
in the lazy light

loons on the lake 
geese in the air 
moose in the woods 
aware    awake

a cry dislodged 
from the musty woods 
the gamy musk 
of the one aroused

the roaming moose 
the rooms lit up 
the woods awake 
in the loony light

the moon dislodged 
the lake aflame 
the Muse amazed 
amused     aroused

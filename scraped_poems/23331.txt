There is the one who turns 
A spoon over like a letter, 
Reading the teeth-marks 
Older than his own;

The one who strikes a match, 
Its light flowering
In his eyes,
The smoke in his throat;

The one who opens the mouth 
Of a dog to listen
To the sea, white-tipped
And blind, feel its way to shore.

At night
They walk in the streets, 
The dust skirting their legs 
Raw with lice

And the wind funneled 
Through a doorway
Where someone might pray 
For a loaf of good luck.

               *

Somewhere the old follow 
Their canes down
A street where the front 
Pages of a newspaper

Scuttle faceless
And the three-legged dog hops home. 
A door is locked twice
And flies ladder a scale of fish.

Somewhere a window yellows 
From a lantern. A child
With fever, swabbed in oils 
And mint, his face

Spotted like an egg, 
His cry no different 
Than the cry
That shakes the trees lean.

A candle is lit for the dead 
Two worlds ahead of us all.

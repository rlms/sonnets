Last night, when the moon 
slipped into my attic room
as an oblong of light, 
I sensed she'd come to commiserate.

It was August. She traveled
with a small valise 
of darkness, and the first few stars 
returning to the northern sky,

and my room, it seemed, 
had missed her. She pretended 
an interest in the bookcase
while other objects 

stirred, as in a rock pool, 
with unexpected life: 
strings of beads in their green bowl gleamed,
the paper-crowded desk; 

the books, too, appeared inclined 
to open and confess. 
Being sure the moon 
harbored some intention,

I waited; watched for an age 
her cool gaze shift
first toward a flower sketch 
pinned on the far wall

then glide down to recline 
along the pinewood floor, 
before I'd had enough. Moon, 
I said, We're both scarred now.

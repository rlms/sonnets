In different cities, on different
 forms of transportation, a woman read Daniel Deronda
 until the year became the arbitrary pink
 the calendar chose for the middle of winter.
 And finally she sat in the reference section
 of the public library finishing Daniel Deronda
 for days at a slowing pace between pieces
of newspapers and foreign language newspapers

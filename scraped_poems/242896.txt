Whose table is that, left on three legs?
If there's been a mistake, it may be 
in assuming less vulnerability 
as one fills the vase—

whose buoyant comfort exaggerates 
at the sight of his own proffered, 
sympathetic hand, striking him so clean
in comparison

gloved white, magician—for a sec 
he even sees the calla lily's furl
in the gesture of voilà!

In the damp sick
In the dough
In the chewed on chew of faces
of expensive car owner faces
chewed ons of the world:
I do not fetishize the truth
I poke around
Holding my bland sandwich
in my non-dominant hand, I think
what could be worse, I think
what could be as bad?

To feel the thing you want
to feel and not to care

To be a wet road
in the dark

I'd like to thank
Toyota, like to thank
my parents, esthetician
Ritalin Clonazepam internet TV weed
my beautiful dresses

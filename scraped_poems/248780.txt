frangelico


It slops from coppery
glass Dominican cassocks

thicker than water,
thinned syrup crackling

and smoking over ice,
pale as hearts of  hazelnuts

half-caramelized
or relics lit in cabinets.

Angelic alcoholic for kids,
all quickening sweetness

without the burnt palate,
it's praline, gilt, milk chocolate.

Don't knock it. Also,
don't drink a lot of it.

Handy mnemonic for nuts
and Alps, the Piedmont

 and Languedoc, Our Father,
fluent Occitan, Orthodox

baroque brass fixtures,
all the schmaltzy

terror of Christmas    ...    
Bright liqueur, maple sap,

throat's lacquer, misnomer,
namesake — couldn't quench

a thirst, of course,
but gives occasion for it.




lametta


Fuck me, I love that stuff —
tinsel stripped

like a tarragon stalk
of its million radial tines,

nervy with static
in shredded cascades,

angle-confounding
and biddable as a fistful

of grasshoppers.
It implicates itself perpetually

in socks, hell-bent
as Japanese knotweed

on travel, and infiltrates
the kitchenette, which seems,

beside its disco stooks,
too much of a muchness,

too matter-of-fact.
Could we dress all utilities

in spangles of lametta,
revel in the vulgar

Italian TV
indestructible attention-splatter,

the cat-bewitching
twitch and dangle, the dross?

Would things be worse
or better?




periptero


Apparently
peripatetic, it pops up

wherever I go, glistening
on my shoulder, a gold epaulette,

a stuffed piñata
albatross of bubble-gum, filter tips,

and lottery tickets, glossy
cascades of laminated sleaze

difficult to care about,
much harder to reject.

Less explicably there are
sewing patterns, puzzle books,

and tiny plastic helicopters
bearing stigmata

from the molds where they were cast.
The proprietor slams

the shutters up
and locks himself inside

like a djinn in a lamp,
a night-busy, helping-hand

kobold in a kitchen,
utterly invested in the enterprise,

inseparable from it. What
is the epicenter everyone reports

but the staple through
the nipple of a centerfold?

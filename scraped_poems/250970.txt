•
The year endingwith the month of parakeetswho didn't let anyone sleepwith their demented squawking.The day we lowered our armsbelieving we were raising them.
•
An arm, a fragment of an armcongealed on the left margin:the photograph in which we're posing like touristsin the ugliest city in the world.An extremity outside the framepointing toward a placewithout historical value.That photograph,the mechanics of a smile set in motionby a signal from the stranger who took it.
•
To keep from dwelling on the imminentlet's speculate about the fate of a friend from elementary schoolwho always covered his notebooks in pink.Or let's be practicaland calculate our taxes.

May God keep you, she thinks.Blessings, she says.

Every four months,with technical precision,Mom asks if I'm gay.
•
Son (leaving the table): See you tomorrow.Mother (under her breath): God willing.
•
Vacation of '91,before nightfall,downloading the catalogueof bootlegs.The Exorcist on repeat for weeksto commit the dialogue to memory:15 years later, nothing remains.A vacation'suseless exercise.The crisis of our 40s at 22.
•
The weeds growwhen we're not watching them.Years accumulatewhile we worry about the weeds.Learning this took longer than we would have liked.
•
“See you tomorrow.”“If that's God's will,” she corrects me.
•
From the sun, surpassed againby rotation and refraction,a few minutes of orange light are leftflattering the silhouettesof the park's elderly, unmoving.This is how it is or this is how I see it throughthe extenuating filterof 10mg of Klonopin.
•
The fog of the drug,low-impact anecdotesand scenes from badly dubbed films.At that hour of the morningwhen the transvestitesbegin to grow a beard.
•
Vices explain the glassy stareof someone who saw someone elseironing the old bills firston the cleared section of a table cluttered with stolen appliancesto later, meticulously,restore each one with Scotch tape.
•
Jorge (the gardener) is weeding.“See you tomorrow.”“God be with you.”
•
Parents' housea gluttonous Sunday(pants unbuttoned),every idea is a capital sinon the sofa in front of the TV.They show the movie about someonewith the heart of a baboonor that's what he'd been tricked into believing since he was a child:the weak musclesubstituted by a fantasy.

Succumbing to the interruption,he writes this:“Above the bar where joy had beenthey built a cathedralout of everything that doesn't belong to me.”
•
Succumbing to the interruption,he recites this:“Kyrie, rex genitor ingenite,vera essentia, eleyson.”
•
Statistic:“I have photographs that used to be ours.”A weak heart. No fantasy.
•
Years and years,hours and hoursdedicated to exercising the brainwhich responds solely to the superficial.An autonomous organdictates the heart's — not at all metaphorical — ache.
•

In my head there's a homunculus who skips stones, also a cripple who drags his dead leg through the sand of the Pacific and the trail that he's leaving behind looks like the handwriting of someone who's hurt you, and the waves come and the waves erase it.

•
Conversations you can't participate in.Piles of overdue books.Keychains without working flashlights.The line of ants looks like a crack in the wall. To write on one's own forearm with the sharp edge of a bitten-off fingernail.Supermarket: rice, mustard, toothpaste, Scotch tape, Tylenol.Jorge (the gardener): 224-5678.Supermarket: salt.Conversations you can't participate in.

Off-center photographsin front of equestrian monuments.León Cortés's arm,the shadow of León Cortés's arm,cast on our 30-year-old biology.Apart from the extras behind us, everythinglooks like a Photoshopped montage.

The children of the Second Republicreproduced without thinking, fed those who shaveheads and chests and armpits.Secretly they know it's Independence Day,August 2nd.
•
Every four months,like an auditor,his mother asks if he is an addict.
•
May God keep you, she thinks.Bless, she says.
•
Out-of-focus photographs,photographs of people who consume anxiolytics rolled-up in a candy wrapperwhile they watch badly dubbed films.A cinema in the suburbs, one afternoon, a screening for the unemployed.
•
I have these photographs that used to be ours.If we superimpose the faces,Linda Blair appears,that transvestite appears,the one we've known since elementary school.
•
In place of the heart,a stone in the shapeof La Virgen Criollawho liberated us from the Spanish,from your mother, from your brothers, from obesity,from understanding the mystery of the Trinity.
•
On the coast of the Pacific we'd watch the fire attentivelyas if it were an intelligent TV.The glitter of gel in your hairwas a host of mortal stars, diminutive,extinguishing themselves. 
•
It could be worse.This is how we arrive at our 40s.By the grace of God,the fog will soon disperse,so that we can take a photograph of the group, of the country,so that we can begin again where the cripple left off.

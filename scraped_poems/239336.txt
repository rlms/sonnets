Words torn, unseen, unseemly, scene
some far suburb's mall lot 
Summer's theme: this year's humid
—to sweat is to know—
pen squeezed too tight yields 
ink as blood or pus 
so the phrase scraped, removed 
offending thine eye: “Outsource Bush” 
Against which, insource what? Who 
will do it? Most terrible 
predicate—high above mountains snow-capped 
even in August in-flight motion 
picture Eternal Sunshine of the 
Spotless Mind

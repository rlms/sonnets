She never spoke, which made her obvious,
the way death makes the air obvious
in an empty chair, the way sky compressed

between bare branches is more gray or blue,
 the way a window is more apparent than a wall. 
She held her silence to her breast like a worn coat,
 smoke, an armful of roses. Her silence 
colored the smaller silences that came and went,
 that other students stood up and filled in.

I leaned near the window in my office. She sat 
on the edge of a chair. Hips rigid, fidgeting 
while I made my little speech. February

light pressed its cold back against the glass, 
sealing us in. She focused on my lips
 as I spoke, as if to study how it's done, 
the sheer mechanics of it: orchestration 
of jaw and tongue, teeth shifting in tandem, 
shaping the air. So I stopped, let her silence

drift over us, let it sift in like smoke or snow, 
let its petals settle on my shoulders. 
I looked outside to the branches

of a stripped tree, winter starlings
 folded in their speckled wings, chilled flames
 shuddering at the tips. Students wandered
 across campus as if under water, hands and hair
 unfurling, their soundless mouths churning— 
irate or ecstatic, I couldn't tell—ready to burn

it all down or break into song. When I looked back 
her eyes had found the window: tree, students, 
birds swimming by, mute in their element.

It was painful to hear the papery rasp 
of her folding and unfolding hands, to watch 
color smudging her neck and temple, branching 
to mist the delicate rim of one ear. I listened 
to the air sunder between us, the feverish hush 
collapse. I could hear her breath—smoke

rising from ice. I could see what it cost her 
to make that leap. What heat it takes 
for the body to blossom into speech.

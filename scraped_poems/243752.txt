in a Tex-Mex restaurant. His co-workers,
unable to utter his name, renamed him Jalapeño. 

If I ask for a goldfish, he spits a glob of phlegm 
into a jar of water. The silver letters 

on his black belt spell Sangrón. Once, borracho, 
at dinner, he said: Jesus wasn't a snowman. 

Arriba Durango. Arriba Orizaba. Packed 
into a car trunk, he was smuggled into the States. 

Frijolero. Greaser. In Tucson he branded 
cattle. He slept in a stable. The horse blankets 

oddly fragrant: wood smoke, lilac. He's an illegal. 
I'm an Illegal-American. Once, in a grove 

of saguaro, at dusk, I slept next to him. I woke 
with his thumb in my mouth. ¿No qué no 

tronabas, pistolita? He learned English 
by listening to the radio. The first four words 

he memorized: In God We Trust. The fifth: 
Percolate. Again and again I borrow his clothes. 

He calls me Scarecrow. In Oregon he picked apples. 
Braeburn. Jonagold. Cameo. Nightly, 

to entertain his cuates, around a campfire, 
he strummed a guitarra, sang corridos. Arriba 

Durango. Arriba Orizaba. Packed into 
a car trunk, he was smuggled into the States. 

Greaser. Beaner. Once, borracho, at breakfast, 
he said: The heart can only be broken 

once, like a window. ¡No mames! His favorite 
belt buckle: an águila perched on a nopal. 

If he laughs out loud, his hands tremble. 
Bugs Bunny wants to deport him. César Chávez 

wants to deport him. When I walk through 
the desert, I wear his shirt. The gaze of the moon 

stitches the buttons of his shirt to my skin. 
The snake hisses. The snake is torn.

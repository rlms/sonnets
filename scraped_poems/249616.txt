The state of my text is an act of worship to a black female God that told me to worship capital.   From   a   business perspective  my   poetics is   about marketing a God who fondles with my white self. This is what makes my poetry so friendly to the void in the world. I marketed a God who exploits me to bring her message of panic to the poetry sector. I was watching a Kenneth Anger film when a large aphrodisiac God converged on me and told me to create a poem that pleases her. The results of her visit are collected in books called Hit Wave and Right Now the Music and the Life Rule. The text in these books is to give the audience hope for life today because a black female God told me to.

Sometimes I say I'm going to meet my sister at the café— 
even though I have no sister—just because it's such 
a beautiful thing to say. I've always thought so, ever since

I read a novel in which two sisters were constantly meeting 
in cafés. Today, for example, I walked alone 
on the wet sidewalk, wearing my rain boots, expecting

someone might ask where I was headed. I bought 
a steno pad and a watch battery, the store windows 
fogged up. Rain in April is a kind of promise, and it costs

nothing. I carried a bag of books to the café and ordered 
tea. I like a place that's lit by lamps. I like a place 
where you can hear people talk about small things,

like the difference between azure and cerulean, 
and the price of tulips. It's going down. I watched 
someone who could be my sister walk in, shaking the rain

from her hair. I thought, even now florists are filling 
their coolers with tulips, five dollars a bundle. All over 
the city there are sisters. Any one of them could be mine.

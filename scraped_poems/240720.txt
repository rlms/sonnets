For Grandfather, in Bangkok
I can tell you, sweeping the several jigsaw lizards
          away from your casket, away from their expert
                    invasions, kneeling by the order of our births
 alongside the mother-of-pearl mosaics,
          the family at your death keeps to form,
                   having to act out that love of endings.
  
 I can say the little I know of how you lived
          is your patient gaze in old photographs,
                    surrounded by three generations, most of the spindling
 offspring back from the States or Australia or wherever
           they'd been taken, children barely known but abided
                    on holidays. Today I'm told we have to place
  
 pennies in the dead man's mouth
          to remind us of the portions
                   left behind.
 You pay the debt,
            someone says, you give your something solid back,
                      push your currency up against the open,
 
up against the father tongue.

I have seen the legislators
 on their way,
 the jacketless men
 in mid-winter who will cast
 their votes like stones for this war.
  
 Men who have to cross the street
 through slush
 and over gutter, their cuffs
 now vaguely blued with a salt
 that dries in dots where it splashes,
  
 and mingles with the finely
 woven cloth
 of the chalk-stripe suits,
 the soi-disant practical men,
 you can see them now tiptoeing,
  
 now leaping, balletic, windsor-knotted,
 fragrant
 and shaved,
 they pass, they pass
 the window of the Capitol Deli
  
 wherein I am writing to my friend
 in Baghdad,
 he a “witness for peace,” 
 a poet who for years has wondered
 what good poetry is or has been or does.
  
 I compose today's answer from here,
 saying,
I think of poetry
as a salt dug from a foreign mine

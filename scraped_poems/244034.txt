I killed a great silver fish, 
cut him open with a long

thin knife. The river carried 
his heart away. I took his

dead eyes home. His red flesh 
sang to me on the fire I built

in my backyard. His taste 
was the lost memory of my

wildness. Behind amber clouds 
of cedar smoke, Orion

drew his bow. A black moon rose 
from the night's dark waters,

a sliver of its bright face 
reflecting back into the universe.

There was a time 
we had functional alignment. 
I was your individual 
contributor, you my associate 

director. On Monday 
I said Happy Monday, 
rolling my rimshot grin. 
Ring-fenced 

by cool molecules, 
like cattle, I battled biosimilars, 
sipped local gin; 
I tried my luck at affairs 

and trade fairs, 
optimistic as a fantasy 
suite. I inked the deal, 
the ink slick 

and permanent, 
like President 
Reagan. I didn't sleep 
unless I felt sick. 

Something was always gated 
on a fragile something. 
Everything 
on the critical path. 

The whiteboard, cruel 
as conceptual math, 
scope creep 
like a disease. 

Some of those days, 
our parent showed up, 
bespoke shoes bearing Leckerli. 
I felt like a starlet 

on a cruisy backlot, 
an outpost of opportunity. 
I took on a new role, 
went through the motions 

and the typing pool. 
But the bonus was no bonus, 
any more than the bay. 
Like tender, it started to fray. 

My admin booked a good 
weekend of atrocity. I winced. 
I slid the To-Hurt folder below 
a molecule's Package Insert. 

Then came the Efficiency 
Report, my resignation. 
I packed up the brood 
for Orlando, a last resort. 

I cut off my khaki pants 
at the knee, traded in the wife — 
this is the Epcot Center of my life! 
I want to thank you in advance. 

I'd fallen out of favor, like a nation.

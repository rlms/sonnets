My four-year-old daughter handed me a card. 
To Daddy written on the front
and inside a rough field 
of â€Šfive-pointed lights, and the words
You're my favorite Daddy in the stars.

In this western night we all light the sky
like Vega, Deneb, Altair, Albireo, 
the Summer Triangle, 
Cygnus the Swan, our hair 
tangled with wood and gravel, 
our eyes like vacant docks
that beckon every boat.

Tell me about the word
stars, I said.

Oh, she said. Sorry. 
I didn't know
how to spell world.

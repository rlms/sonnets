            Oh, dangling long sleeves in the Mercurochrome.
             Parking her punch on her knees.
  
      I'm not a joiner.
  
             In the night, a visitation, small as a thumb,
             enters the sealed house and ascends.
  
      Mother wouldn't have stood for that long. Drippy-drooping around
 on heels. Leaving the blue cheese out.

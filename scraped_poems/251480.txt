Indigenous Elvis works security:
 Chief Joseph hair, blue-black and pomped,
 turquoise and shell dangling from one ear,
 silver chunks of rings on every bronze knuckle.
  
 Indigenous Elvis works security:
 X-ray glances at your backpacks,
 laptops, empty still-moist shoes.
  
 Indigenous Elvis waves me to his line.
 A perfect gentlemen at all times,
 gingerly lifting my naked phone,
 holding the line as I return my computer
 and extra undies to my briefcase.
  
 Next line, next flight, Indigenous Elvis eases in
 too close, asks, "Where you headed
 this time?"
 Subtle tango, I lean away, wondering what it is 
 he saw first gave me away—
 My beaded barrettes in their travel case?
 A slight turn to my eyes?
  
 Oh, mortification when I get him!
 Indigenous Elvis, at security, a third time.
 He lifts my carry-on,
 maneuvers my hand, gestures me close to ask,
"How is my sweetheart?"
 Then against my neck, so my hairs rise
 with his sight, "How's my sweetheart doing … 
 your sister … ?
... the one that got away."

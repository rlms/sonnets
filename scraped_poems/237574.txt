The jolt that comes to bones inside a tumbled streetcar

 is what the painter considers as she strokes her-
self into story. There is less to the jolt that
  
 comes as he shuts his eyes before the monitor, save

 what he imagines—a lightning bolt, a god tapping
the shoulder. He imagines the sky swelling
 
 with ceiling fans or the guano of extinct birds,
  
 a jolt riding from his shoulder
 blades to his eyelids, dropping with roller
  
 coaster clacks to his fingers. Here, he dreams of Frida

 Kahlo. Here, he says, let me spread my flesh out like a
 table linen, let my bones be silver that touches,
  
 making, again, that clack. My skull will be a glass,
  
 set properly, I have class enough.

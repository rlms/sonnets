Coleman Hawkins doing that thing

with his sax: high
and lonely as a kestrel
twirls on thermals, sorting
files of sound with a singular

finger, now alightingÂ 

in pools of light, hovering
then fixed like whirring
wings of the insect glazed
in serous amber but

dreaming of oxygen:

Sound leading a mind
into that sobriety
of thought which poises
the heart. Sound like that,

holding and giving out
never. Sound quickened
with desire. Sound

the benefit of nature

in taut bolts of time, rich
polychrome threads, count:
Two-sixty. Sound blots out

the violence of affliction

bringing it home lonely
but good, letting
it bend: We
had much more reason being

winged ones to recollect than forget.

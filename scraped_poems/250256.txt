         I. “Before the War”

“Before the war”
means Fresno, a hedged-in house,
two dogs in the family.

Blackie, the small one, mine,
lapped at his insides
on the floorboard, on the way to the doctor.

Jimmy, my father's shepherd, 
wouldn't eat after the evacuation. 
He wouldn't live with another master

and pined away, skin and bone.

With feelings more than pride, 
we call him our one-man dog.      

          II. Mud

Mud in the barracks—
a muddy room, a chamber pot.

Mud in the moats
around each barracks group.

Mud on the shoes 
trudging to the mess hall.

Mud in the swamp
where the men chopped wood.

Mud on the guts 
under a loaded wagon—

crushed in the mud by the wheel.

        III.  Desert Songs

1. all that we gathered

Because there was little else to do, 
they led us to the artillery range 
for shells, all that we gathered, 
and let us dig among dunes 
for slugs, when they were through.

Because there was little else to do, 
one of them chased a stray 
with his tail between his legs
 and shot him through the head.

2. shells
A desert tortoise—
 something mute and hard—

something to decorate 
a desert Japanese garden:

gnarled wood, smooth 
artillery shells for a border.

When a guard 
smashes one, the shell

cracks open and the muscles ooze.

3. it is only natural

The pheasant is an Oriental creature,
so it is only natural
that one should fly into camp

and, famished by rations and cans, 
break out in secret, native dance
 over a fire, on a black coal stove.

4. song of the 442nd 

Caged creatures 
have curious moods.

Some of them choose 
to be turned

loose in a group, 
to take their chances

in the open.

5. steers

Because a dentist
logically drives a butcher truck,

I rode with my father
to the slaughterhouse on an afternoon.

Not hammers, not bullets,
 could make him close his eyes.

6. he teaches

He jerks the eyes
 from birds, feet 
from lizards,

and punishes
 ants with the gaze 
of a glass.

And with his sly 
gaze, his child's face,
 he teaches

what has its place, 
and must be
 passed on to others.

        IV. Song of Chicago

When the threat lessened, 
when we became tame, 
my father and friends
 took a train to Chicago

for factory work, 
for packaging bolts.
 One grew a mustache 
and called himself Carlos.

And they all made a home 
with those of their own—

rats, bedbugs, blacks.

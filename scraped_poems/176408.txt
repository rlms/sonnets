Is it peace, Is it a philosopher's honeymoon, one finds  On the dump? —Wallace Stevens
Out of the cracks of cups and their handles, missing,   
the leaves unceremoniously tossed, unread, 
from a stubble of coffee ground ever more finely   
into these hollowed grounds, 

the first shift coaxes bulldozers to life, 
sphinxes to tease the riddled rubble 
into fresh pyramids of rot. A staleness warms enough   
to waft round the lord of all purveyed. 

His to count the hauls past the yawning gates   
of this New Giza into the Middle Kingdom's   
Late Intermediate Period. There, to purify,   
to honor ourselves, we beg these offerings 

of refuse be cast out. To the archaeologist   
of the far-flung future, enough evidence 
in the inscriptions to identify most owners:   
spells scratched on the backs of envelopes 

to be read out before animal sacrifice, 
the milk, ground meat, beer, and soap

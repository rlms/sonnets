We walked five blocks 
to the elementary school, 
my mother's high heels 
crunching through playground gravel. 
We entered through a side door.

Down the long corridor, 
decorated with Halloween masks, 
health department safety posters— 
we followed the arrows 
to the third grade classroom.

My mother stepped alone 
into the booth, pulling the curtain behind her. 
I could see only the backs of her 
calves in crinkled nylons.

A partial vanishing, then reappearing 
pocketbook crooked on her elbow, 
our mayor's button pinned to her lapel. 
Even then I could see—to choose
is to follow what has already 
been decided.

We marched back out 
finding a new way back down streets 
named for flowers 
and accomplished men. 
I said their names out loud, as we found

our way home, to the cramped house, 
the devoted porch light left on, 
the customary meatloaf.
I remember, in the classroom converted 
into a voting place— 
there were two mothers, conversing, 
squeezed into the children's desk chairs.

most of my regrets         have to do with
water,
light    filtered through shower curtain,
your skin          like yellowed paper.
i sat on bathroom                  tiles cold
like clammy hands i didn't want
to hold
and waited for you.
i didn't think to be embarrassed then.


neither                           of us could sleep
that night.        the floorboards creaked
and    only now do i feel guilty
about sneaking into bed with you.


but that was months ago.
in a room         i'll never see again
parts of us have begun to die.


they say that every
seven years your body replaces      each
cell it has ever known.


soon i will be new again.


some nights in my dorm room
i wake up crying and there's
nothing                          humble about it.
when moonlight spills across    my
bed like ilfosol-3, gets caught in my
throat like a soreness,


it isn't because i miss you.
rather, the dark room at
my old high school where i used tongs


to move your picture from one
chemical bath to another.
in a room i'll never see again
your face develops right in front
of me.

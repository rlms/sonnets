That marsh hawk,
its blown-leaf flight 
across Tomales Bay fog, 
summer's abraded light,
the Pacific tide pressuring
and squeezing wave on wave 
into the bay's pinched inlet. . .
We feel somehow between us
still water crushed by that sea,
so constant it seems not to be.
The hawk, a circus, tumbles,
stops, stands upon the air,
beats its wings as if to shoo 
the sun's drenched veils, 
and its clapping wings stop
our unstoppable argument,
that love goes, who knows why,
and delivers us from pain 
to pain, air with teeth 
that seems to eat more air.  
Northern harrier, owl face, 
they sea-changed your name,
who listens with your face
and shows not love but want, 
speed, life in flight 
toward, forever toward,
pausing at every chance
to use what ocean-born
bayside air sustains you
by resisting you. We thank
your sunken head bones
and wild close-to-water seeking
that somehow speaks to us,
           delivers us 
                    to another amazed 
                              agonized place.

Speak to the Rev holding the light-skinned baby, ask his son to come put a new inner tube on my bike. Cross Ludlow, past the mailbox on the corner, Risqu√© Video, Dino's Pizza, and the Emerald Laundromat. The fruit trucks tucked into 44th Street on the left, house eyes shut with boards, fringes of children. Once we went into a store sunk into the street, owned by a Cambodian woman. She sold everything, from evening gowns to soup. Over to Walnut and 45th, where the Muslim cat sells this chicken wrapped in pita, draped in cucumber sauce. The pregnant woman behind the counter writes our order out in Arabic. We grab a juice from the freezer, some chips, eye the bean and sweet potato pies.Back into the hot breath of West Philly, sun is setting. The sky is smeared squash, tangerines in a glaze. Three girls and one boy jump doubledutch. A white man hustles from the video store with a black plastic bag. We look for money in the street, steal flowers from the church lawn. The shit stain from the winois still on our step. Mr. Jim is washing a car for cash.John is cleaning his rims to Buju Banton.Noel is talking sweetly to the big blue-eyed woman.Linda, on her way to the restaurant. The sisterin the wheelchair buzzes by with her headphones on.One night, a man was shot and killed on this block, right outside our thick wood door. But not today. Today is one of those days to come home from walkingin the world, leave the windows open, start a pot of black beans. Smoke some Alice Coltrane. Cut up some fruit, toenails. Hold on to the moment as if time is taking your blood pressure.

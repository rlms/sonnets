You're flush with hearts and I'm forced to fold 
this hand and swear off another luckless match.
How we've found ways to love each other, cajoled
our cindered hearts, flushed and forced to fold 
upon themselves like Saint Valentine ensouled
with seizure, skin a whirring bee swarm, a hatched 
flush of doves. My heart, how I'm forced to fold 
my hands in prayer for another struck match.

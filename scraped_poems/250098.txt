Once, I was as large
as any living creature could be.

I could lift the world and carry it
from my breast to its bath.

When I looked down from the sky
you could see the love in my eye:

“Oh, tiny world, if anything
ever happened to you, I would die.”

And I said, “No!” to the hand. Snatched
the pebble from the mouth, fished it out

and told the world it would choke!
Warned the world over & over! “Do

you hear me? Do you want to choke?!”

But how was the world to know
what the truth might be? Perhaps

they grant you special powers, these
choking stones. Maybe

When it snows, he stands
at the back door or wanders 
around the house to each 
window in turn and
watches the weather
like a lover. O farm boy,
I waited years
for you to look at me
that way. Now we're old 
enough to stop waiting
for random looks or touches 
or words, so I find myself 
watching you watching
the weather, and we wait
 together to discover
whatever the sky might bring.

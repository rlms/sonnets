In green water I saw your eye and in it I saw that Arabian palace 
filled with birds and broken glass.
                                                                  I copy an address into my right hand 
and fill myself with memories of psalms. 
A green fish emerges from seaweed as seaweed from a wave
                                                                  that rises like the wailing wall.

My sun-baked body at the edge,
wind in my lungs, its whistle,
my torn world, my grief,
my soggy passport, my shell with no pearl,
you lift them, delicate cloud, into a liquid world.

Last night I dreamed of my father's flabby body and of my blue 
resolve to run away, to find a way, I dreamed of your eye
                                                            and for an instant I found the vertex of the road, 
the imaginary line that falls across the earth:
               that meridian where the sun on a tiger's back meets the shade at its belly.

Waking up, we are swallowed by wakefulness.
The house swallows us in its terrible thirst. The routine of taking our children
to school swallows us
                                                   and so does the if only I could.

Year after year after year 
I have come to love slowly

how old houses hold themselves—

before November's drizzled rain 
or the refreshing light of June—

as if they have all come to agree 
that, in time, the days are no longer 
a matter of suffering or rejoicing.

I have come to love 
how they take on the color of rain or sun 
as they go on keeping their vigil

without need of a sign, awaiting nothing

more than the birds that sing from the eaves, 
the seizing cold that sounds the rafters.

You are invulnerable. Didn't they deliver
(those forces that control your destiny)
the certainty of dust? Couldn't it be
your irreversible time is that river
in whose bright mirror Heraclitus read 
his brevity? A marble slab is saved
for you, one you won't read, already graved
with city, epitaph, dates of the dead.
And other men are also dreams of time, 
not hardened bronze, purified gold. They're dust
like you; the universe is Proteus. 
Shadow, you'll travel to what waits ahead,
the fatal shadow waiting at the rim. 
Know this: in some way you're already dead.

In first grade, you met Squanto, 
nearly naked and 
on his haunches, showing 
those thick-headed pilgrims 
how one must plant fish
to grow maize. And in autumn 
you dove into the lobotomized 
pumpkin, into the gooey pulp 
and seeds, raising a clump 
like a slimy chandelier
from the Titanic. And now 
in late summer, daughter, 
you smile, holding a ripe watermelon, 
cut in half, exposing the black 
seed within its bright red heart. 
Your melon. How proud you are 
to think you grew this delicious 
thing all on your own.

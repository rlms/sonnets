They hung the paintings to be viewed from both front and back. 
Luna moths flapped their great green sail-wings.
Stingrays flapped their great gray sail-wings. 
Those visiting the exhibition were encouraged to touch. 
Captions were available in Braille and audio. 
The exhibition tasted like cherries. 
A critic asked if the exhibition was a “facile juxtaposition of   ideals.”
The mother of the exhibition calls constantly and the father, never.
The exhibition has taken to pouring a little scotch in the coffee. 
When designing layout, remember 
it is crucial how a bias cut fits at the exhibition's hips
and foot traffic turns to the right, not the left. 
They hung the sculptures to be viewed from both above and below.
They painted the walls a shade of “eggshell, minus calcium.”
The exhibition did not consider itself an exhibitionist
until the incident at the east window.
The exhibition is very sorry and will refund upon request.
Stingrays flapped their great gray sail-wings. 
Luna moths flapped their great green sail-wings.
No matter how short a trip, the exhibition packs two pairs of shoes. 
The exhibition never knows when it is coming home again.

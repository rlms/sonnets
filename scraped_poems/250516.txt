I found you
on Gothtrash.com
and saved your picture
to my computer desktop
it gives me the feelingÂ 
of something terrible
and familiar
a space
between lives
like seeing Marcel
seeing Gilberte
for the first time
how the fact of life itself
becomes a thing
languished and melancholy
I think I would like to lie
among southern magnolias
in snowfall
dark skies above
into which
I will never enter
I'm watching Maya Deren
maybe I will smoke weed
I called out sick
it's the afternoon

for Rick Hill and in memory of Buster Mitchell
I 
Steel arches up 
past the customs sheds, 
the bridge to a place 
named Canada,
 thrust into Mohawk land. 

A dull rainbow 
arcing over 
the new school,
 designed to fan 
out like the tail 
of the drumming Partridgeâ€” 
dark feathers of the old way's pride 
mixed in with blessed Kateri's 
pale dreams of sacred water. 

II 
When that first span 
fell in 1907 
cantilevered shapes collapsed,
 gave like an old man's
arthritic back.

 The tide was out, 
the injured lay trapped like game in a deadfall
 all through that day 
until the evening.
 Then, as tide came in, 
the priest crawled 
through the wreckage, 
giving last rites 
to the drowning. 

III 
Loading on, 
the cable lifts.
 Girders swing 
and sing in sun. 
Tacked to the sky, 
reflecting wind, 
long knife-blade mirrors
 they fall like jackstraws 
when they hit the top
 of the big boom's run. 

The cable looped, 
the buzzer man 
pushes a button 
red as sunset. 
The mosquito whine 
of the motor whirrs 
bare bones up to 
the men who stand 
an edge defined 
on either side 
by a long way down.

 IV 
Those who hold papers
 claim to have ownership 
of buildings and land. 
They do not see the hands 
which placed each rivet. 
They do not hear the feet 
walking each hidden beam. 
They do not hear the whisper 
of strong clan names. 
They do not see the faces 
of men who remain
 unseen as those girders 
which strengthen and shape.

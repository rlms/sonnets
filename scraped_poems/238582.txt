for Shari Lewis (1934-1998)
Once again, I've missed Lamb Chop's Play-Along
Which, as it is, isn't
broadcast in Papiamento, myself being the Centurion
of the English where I am

Aha! The Brook, Cherith running by here meaning
the while I can “compare notes” with Elijah
(Without a Jezebel to spook him!)
Although admittedly
in the movie Betty Davis is a winnter, ever quite
without a struggle
           Especially in the Waltz sequence

Which continues to reverberate in my head. So that I ask

“Is it, I, then, that am “The Revenant”?

This McTalk
with its “scrolling windows”
can never answer. But just now, could use

A bit of that compote of “stewed pears

          With cinnamon”

The discalced
                    Carmelite Sisters
fed San Juan De La Cruz
thus, nursing and resusciating him back 
                                           to “health”
Which is, in itself, at best
         —a provisional state!

Other than that,

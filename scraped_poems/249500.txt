One day the children played


in the kitchen.
in the cellar.
in the yard.



The yard looked like


a meadow.
a forest.
an island in the sea.



The children forgot their


mud cakes,
swing set,
sticks,



when a girl taught them


cat's cradles.
clay people.
folded paper boats.



Late afternoon, whispering, they lay


in a sandbox.
on the sidewalk.
in the grass.



Each knew the others had


a mother.
a father.
brothers, sisters, dogs.



They traded blood oaths that foretold


how close.
how long.
at what cost.

Deep reaches of sleep until the unforeseen
moment, like fugue, like petit mal, some kind of sign,

a touch from a joker's finger, to let him know what's right,

They went to the river and dropped their clothes on the bank.
She struck out. He followed in the long, slow vee of her wake.

She could sound and surface, bringing back with her what

In this, her fool is deaf and dumb and twirling a pink parasol. In this
he's doing a chicken dance. He turns away and puckers up for a kiss.

In this, he watches from cover, maestro of the deadfall.
He goose-steps them out of the tunnel of love and into the house of glass.

The animal of winter is dying, 
its white body everywhere 
in collapse and stabbed at
by straws of   light, a leaving 
to believe in as the air 
slowly fills with darkness 
and water drains from the tub 
where my daughter, watching it 
lower around her, feeling it 
go, says about the only thing 
she can as if it were a long-
kept breath going with her 
blessing of dribble and fleck.
Down it swirls a living drill
vanishing toward a land
where tomorrow already 
fixes its bright eye on a man
muttering his way into a crowd,
saying about the only thing
he can before his body
goes boom. And tomorrow, 
I will count more dark shapes 
tumbling from the sky, birds 
returning to scarcity, offering 
in their seesawing songs 
a kind of   liquidity.

among thirty dusty men the only wet thing

the mouth of the coyote

is a mini zoo we are from many countries

in which there are many coyotes


500 bucks and we're off think about it

is the shortest verse of a corrido

a gila monster and a coyote are one

a gila monster and a coyote and a gringo are one


strewn bottles melt dirt

the coyote's tongue fills them

we don't know which to swat the coyote or the froth

the mosquitoes or the flies


gringos why do you see us illegal don't you think

we are the workers around you

we speak different accents yours included and we know

tambi√©n the coyote is suspect of what we say


when the coyote hears helicopters 

in Nike shoes he trots Arizona

Nogales whores close their doors

the coyote trots Arizona in Nike shoes


the desert is still the coyote must be tired

in his shadow he sees searchlights

it's day all night it's dusting and it's going to dust

the coyote rests under yuccas

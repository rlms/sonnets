           "After a white reception in the crystal room of the Hotel 
Kenmore, Mrs. George Eustic (Patricia Hays) and her husband 
left on a wedding trip to the Pocono Mountains, Pa. They will 
live in good old Noodleville." (Home.)

Where the friendly purple heart is.

           I like to do things. I like to eat, and things like that. I like 
the things that go on around me. People are nice. And, really, I 
like this place I live in. However, some people don't.

Sally doesn't.

           Sick at heart, the trembling girl shuddered at the words 
that delivered her to this terrible horrible fate of the East.
 "Nasty!" How could she escape from this oriental monster 
into whose hands she had fallen—this strange man whose face 
none had seen.

Smile!

It is only a little picture,
          In a little silver frame,
And across the back is written 
          My darling mother's name.

            I heard a shot—I saw him run—then I saw her fall—the 
woman I love. My leg was broken—and my gun was gone! I had
 only one thought—(tee! hee!)—his strange, astounding plots
 must be avenged—he must die for a coward at my hands! He had 
the courage of a lion and the cunning of a rat. He came running 
towards me when—suddenly, I—

Ran.

. . . and remember those swell picnics in Birch Grove?

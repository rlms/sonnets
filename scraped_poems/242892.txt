In the road, a dog. Days dead, 
that dog. Liliana was walking beside me awhile 
(I am sure) and I was almost not crying but then found 

what I was looking for. 
She heaved it for me—all of it, the stench, the weight—
in her thin arms until it was too much. 

Tired, she dragged the thing by its wasted paws 
all the way home. Her dress was stained. This is how 

I learned about love. She did not mind at all 
the silent, steady distance I placed between us.

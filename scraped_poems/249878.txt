No matter if half the park is concrete 
and stanchions supporting a bridge,

near industrial buildings yellow in the sun,
 their stalks of smoke soaring awake,

next to empty lots and bus stops 
without seats or signs or schedules,

near houses bright with paint 
the color of dented cans of Spam,
 
men walking the streets to work 
look longingly towards their doors.
 
No matter if all the murals decay 
and the statue of Zapata falls,

more months pile to be swept, and years 
ironed, folded, and put away in drawers,

and if jail bars bite off chunks of your view, 
remember a wise gambler's words on craps:

call for the dice back. And between rolls,
 wipe the dust off the dice, as bills coil a foot

in the wind because life is a wild emotion 
lying in the grass, soon to be green.

Not even bags of chips, cheetahs with wind, 
avoid being tackled, gouged, and ripped apart.

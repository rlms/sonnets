FIRST CHEROKEE LESSON: MOURNING

             Find a flint blade
             Use your teeth as a whetstone

             Cut your hair
             Talk to shadows and crows

             Cry your red throat raw

             Learn to translate the words you miss most:
             dust                     love                    poetry

             Learn to say         home

My cracked earth lips
drip words not sung
as lullabies to my infant ears
not laughed over dinner
or choked on in despair
No

They played dead until
the soldiers passed
covered the fields like corpses
and escaped into the mountains
When it's safe we'll find you
they promised
But we were already gone
before sunrise

I crawl through a field of
twisted bodies to find them
I do everything Beginning Cherokee
tells me
Train my tongue
to lie still
Keep teeth tight
against lips
Listen to instruction tapes
Study flash cards

How can I greet my ancestors in a language they don't understand

My tear ducts fill with milk
because what I most love
was lost at birth

My blood roars skin to blisters 
weeps haunted calls of owls
bones splinter
jut through skin
until all of me
is wounded
as this tongue

SECOND CHEROKEE LESSON: GHOSTS

             Leave your hair
             at the foot of your bed

             Scratch your tongue
             with a cricket's claw to speak again

             Stop the blood with cornmeal

             Your ancestors will surround you as you sleep
             keep away ghosts of generals presidents       priests
             who hunger for your
             rare and tender tongue

             They will keep away ghosts
             so you have strength
             to battle the living

Stories float through lives
with an owl's sudden swooping
I knew some Cherokee
when I was little
My cousins taught me

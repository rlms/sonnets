Veiled in velvet, is she here?
      Leave off, leave off:
           You shall not enter,
                you shall not emerge.
      It is neither yours nor your share.

Return...Return:
      The sea is swelling;
           its waves are calling.
                I hold to the holy portion—
      I am held in the holiness of the King.

The line is long, processional, glacial, 
and the attendant a giant stone, cobalt blue 
with flecks of white, I'm not so much 
looking at a rock but a slab of night. 
The stone asks if anything inside the package 
is perishable. When I say no the stone 
laughs, muted thunderclap, meaning 
everything decays, not just fruit 
or cut flowers, but paper, ink, the CD 
I burned with music, and my friend 
waiting to hear the songs, some little joy 
after chemo eroded the tumor. I know flesh 
is temporary, and memory a tilting barn 
the elements dismantle nail by nail. 
I know the stone knows a millennia of rain 
and wind will even grind away 
his ragged face, and all of this slow erasing 
is just a prelude to when the swelling 
universe burns out, goes dark, holds 
nothing but black holes, the bones of stars 
and planets, a vast silence. The stone 
is stone-faced. The stone asks how soon 
I want the package delivered. As fast 
as possible, I say, then start counting the days.

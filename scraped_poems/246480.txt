Shouldn't it ache, this slit 
into the sweet
and salt mix of  waters 

comprising the mussel, 
its labial meats 
winged open: yellow- 

fleshed, black and gray
around the tough
adductor? It hurts

to imagine it, regardless
of the harvester's
denials, swiveling 

his knife to make 
the incision: one
dull cyst nicked

from the oyster's 
mantle — its thread of red 
gland no bigger

than a seed 
of  trout roe — pressed 
inside the tendered

flesh. Both hosts eased
open with a knife 
(as if anything

could be said to be eased
with a knife): 
so that one pearl

after another can be 
harvested, polished, 
added to others 

until a single rope is strung 
on silk. Linked 
by what you think

is pain. Nothing 
could be so roughly 
handled and yet feel 

so little, your pity 
turned into part of this 
production: you 

with your small,
four-chambered heart, 
shyness, hungers, envy: what

could be so precious 
you'd cleave 
another to keep it

close? Imagine 
the weeks it takes to wind 
nacre over the red

seed placed at the other 
heart's mantle. 
The mussel 

become what no one 
wants to:
vessel, caisson, wounded 

into making us 
the thing we want
to call beautiful.

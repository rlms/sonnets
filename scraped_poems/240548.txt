As with this Jet Ski family
          braiding the lake
with bigger and bigger shocks
until the one 
          car-sized one
cuts his engine
and, following him, for an instant 
          they all coast
through silences 
of self-made 
          rain—

how much is required now
                     to carve, 
out of the general
livable quiet, 
          independence?

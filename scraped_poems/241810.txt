There are charms
that forestall harm.
The house bristles
with opportunities
for stasis: refolding
the linens along 
their creases, keeping
the spoons and chairs
in their right places.
Nobody needs to
witness one's exquisite
care with the napkins
for the napkins 
to have been the act
that made the fact
unhappen.

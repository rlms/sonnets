I imagine each enunciation, each syllable 
pronounced—Mississippi—makes a noose
 cinch somewhere, rope reduced
to arousal, tightening. The pull,
 the hard-learned feel of vertebrae supple 
within a neck's column, and marrow's juice
sucked clean until what remains are flutes 
of bone, a wind section of rubble.

Whenever I meet Mississippi in a dream, 
it is always a landfill of labored breaths 
or a grand mammal crippled in morass. 
What did you ever want of us? I ask. It beams,
The same you want for me—the subtle heft
of razors beneath the magnolia tongue's lash.

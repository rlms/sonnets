In siftings of chromatic sediment
Shed by the winter hours as they decay,
With slow descent
Light settles through the lower sky in peach,
Then mauve, then pale self-abnegating gray
Against the water, now that day is spent
At Bennetts Beach,

Under the high withdrawing blueness, band
On band, like layers in a decorative
Bottle of sand,
Enclosed beneath the heavens' dome, as though
This were the perfect realm in which to live,
Preserved, unburdened by the least demand, 
Or wish, to know—

And simply be. Along the beach convene
Some silver gulls which stand around reﬂecting
Upon the sheen
That comes and goes about their scarlet feet,
And crested terns ﬂy back and forth inspecting
The shallows for a last titbit to glean,
And lightly treat

A two-faced wind that works its way across
The metal of the sea it tries to planish
And to emboss,
While deep in its unbalanced buffetings
Gannets alternately appear and vanish,
Plunge, rise, and loft and give their heads a toss.
These things, these things

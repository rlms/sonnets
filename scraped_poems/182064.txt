I 

It is not to be bought for a penny 
in the candy store, nor picked 
from the bushes in the park. It may be found, perhaps, 
in the ashes on the distant lots, 
among the rusting cans and Jimpson weeds. 
If you wish to eat fish freely, 
cucumbers and melons, 
you should have stayed in Egypt. 

II 

I am alone— 
and glad to be alone; 
I do not like people who walk about 
so late; who walk slowly after midnight 
through the leaves fallen on the sidewalks. 
I do not like 
my own face 
in the little mirrors of the slot-machines 
before the closed stores. 

III 

Walking along the highway, 
I smell the yellow flowers of a shrub, 
watch the starlings on a lawn, perhaps— 
but why are all these   
speeding away in automobiles, 
where are they off to 
in such a hurry? 
They must be going to hear wise men 
and to look at beautiful women,   
and I am just a fool 
to be loitering here alone. 

IV 

I like the sound of the street— 
but I, apart and alone, 
beside an open window 
and behind a closed door. 

V 

Winter is here indeed; the leaves have long been swept 
from the winding walks; trees and ground are brown— 
all is in order. 
Only the lamps now flourish in the park. 
We walk about and talk; 
but the troubles of the unsuccessful middle-aged 
are so uninteresting! 

VI 

Now it is cold: where the snow was melting 
the walk crackles with black ice beneath my careful steps; 
and the snow is old and pitted, 
here grey with ashes and there yellow with sand. 
The walks lie in the cold shadow 
of houses; 
pigeons and sparrows are in a hollow 
for cold, out of the wind; but here,   
where the sunshine pours through a narrow street 
upon a little tree, black and naked of every leaf, 
the sparrows are in the sun, thick upon the twigs. 
Those who in their lives braved the anger of their fellows, 
bronze statues now, 
with outstretched arm or sword 
brave only the weather. 

I find myself talking aloud 
as I walk; 
that is bad. 
Only Don Juan would believe 
I am in conversation with the 
snow-covered statues; 
only St. Francis   
that I am talking to the sparrows 
in the naked bushes,   
to the pigeons   
in the snow. 

VII 

The ropes in the wind   
slapping the flag-pole 
(the flag has been hauled down); 
behind the bare tree-tops 
the lights of an aeroplane 
moving away slowly. 

A star or two shining 
between factory chimneys; 
the street dark and still 
because the street-lamp has been broken 
and it is cold and late. 

VIII 

Bright upon the table 
for your birthday, 
the burning candles will dissolve   
in rays 
and lumps of wax. 
Unlike a skull, 
they say politely, 
This is you! 

IX 

I am afraid 
because of the foolishness 
I have spoken. 
I must diet 
on silence; 
strengthen myself 
with quiet. 

Where is the wisdom   
with which I may be medicined? 
I will walk by myself 
and cure myself 
in the sunshine and the wind. 

X 

I do not believe that David killed Goliath. 
It must have been— 
you will find the name in the list of David's captains. 
But, whoever it was, he was no fool 
when he took off the helmet 
and put down the sword and the spear and the shield 
and said, The weapons you have given me are good, 
but they are not mine: 
I will fight in my own way 
with a couple of pebbles and a sling. 

XI 

“Shall I go there?” “As you like— 
it will not matter; you are not at all important.” 
The words stuck to me   
like burrs. The path was hidden 
under the fallen leaves; and here and there 
the stream was choked. Where it forced a way 
the ripples flashed a second. 
She spoke unkindly but it was the truth: 
I shared the sunshine like a leaf, a ripple; 

thinking of this, sunned myself 
and, for the moment, was content. 

XII 

There is nobody in the street 
of those who crowded about David 
to watch me   
as I dance before the Lord: 
alone in my unimportance 
to do as I like. 

XIII 

Your angry words—each false name 
sinks into me, and is added to the heap 
beneath. I am still the same: 
they are no part of me, which I keep; 
but the way I go, and over which I flow. 

XIV 
The Bridge 

In a cloud bones of steel. 

XV 
God and Messenger 

This pavement barren 
as the mountain 
on which God spoke to Moses— 
suddenly in the street 
shining against my legs 
the bumper of a motor car. 

XVI 

A beggar stretches out his hand 
to touch a fur collar, and strokes it unseen, 
stealing its warmth for his finger tips. 

XVII 

The elevator man, working long hours 
for little—whose work is dull and trivial— 
must also greet each passenger 
pleasantly: 
to be so heroic 
he wears a uniform. 

XVIII 

This subway station   
with its electric lights, pillars of steel, arches of cement, and trains— 
quite an improvement on the caves of the cave-men; 
but, look! on this wall 
a primitive drawing. 

XIX 
Subway 

People moving, people standing still, crowds 
and more crowds; a thousand and ten thousand iron girders 
as pillars; 
escape! 
But how, 
shut up in the moving train? 
And upstairs, in the street, 
the sun is shining as it shines in June. 

XX 
Poet with Whiskey Bottle and Sailor 

There is anguish there, certainly, 
and a commotion 
in the next room; 
shouts of 
words and phrases that do not make sentences 
and sentences that do not make sense. 
I open the door: 
ah, the hallway is crowded— 
descendants of the three wise men,   
now male and female, 
come again to worship in a stable. 

XXI 

The white cat on the lawn, 
lying in the sun against the hedge, 
lovely to look at— 
but this stout gentleman, 
who needs a shave badly,   
leaning in an arbor hung with purple grapes, 
purple grapes all about him, 
is unpleasant. 
Am I becoming misanthropic? 
An atheist? 
Why, this might be the god Bacchus! 

XXII 

The bearded rag-picker 
seated among heaps of rags in a basement 
sings: 
It was born that way; 
that is the way it was born— 
the way it came out of some body 
to stink: 
nothing will change it— 
neither pity nor kindness.

Delphine is snug in the corruptible quiet, her heart all lurgy.
She is vigorous with postures and slackening her jaw.
The vogue memory is how when she was ten she stuck
her tongue out really far and her friend said,
“That makes you a lemon.” Retrospectively,
what she wanted was a perm
and a dad that gave money for the arcade.

Delphine lies down in the corner and gets up and lies down again, etc.
This is so she knows she's lain down on every bit of the ﬂoor.

There's no one to see, so makeup is taken very seriously.
If she French kisses the window her hair starts to curl — 
it is all very boudoir. Delphine expected to be bored.
What she needs to say aloud is smooch.

Delphine's heart is more woolen than sure.
She nipped off the fur buds
from the pussy willow and strung them
into a necklace — a means of clustering wants.
In the faraway land, her old milk glass
holds other people's toothbrushes and curdling water.

Precision here is superﬂuous as cut ﬂowers. On the seafront
the shrubs are meek in the blossoming wind.
Delphine has worked on her complexion.
Bestowed with peaches, she's personal limelight.

At night her cruelties sneak up the ladder of her throat.
Its delphinedelphinedelphine on steamed-up mirrors,
always in joined-up ﬁnger-writing.

Singing is only permitted in the dark. Delphine is judging
her own obedience. Look at me being strict! But she has
to remind herself of the rules, hourly. Deceit is its own discipline.

Today the shrubs are insolent, waiting for adults to prepare a new game.
Delphine considers ceremonial magic, but how to practice
without a little magic escaping?



9


Wish yourself into a lovely place, she thinks. Loveliness
would include shrubs without such expressions!

Wisdom may well have been squandered on seafronts
and lipstick. So many years afraid of waste is its own
waste

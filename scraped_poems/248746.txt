I'm being carried down
the Burlington Arcade
by Beadles in top hats,
jewelers on both sides
holding out their hands
and wrapped in cashmere.
When people speak of
near-death experiences
they're always going through
tunnels, they're happy,
they're never going through
the Burlington Arcade.

Eric says, It's good
to see you wearing clothes
and I have to admit he's
wearing the most beautiful
trousers and I say, Eric
you're not supposed to be
in this poem. Get back
into your shop! I can see
a light at the end of the tunnel.
The Head Beadle's saying
“Burlington Gardens!”

Should I tip him?
Am I dead?
What happens next?

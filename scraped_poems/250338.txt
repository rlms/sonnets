A quarter of a century
 since we left high school, 
and we've gathered at a posh restaurant. 
A little heavier, a little grayer,
 we look for the yearbook pictures 
caught inside these bodies of strangers. 
Some of our faces are etched with lines,
 the faint tracing of a lover's touch,
 and some of our hair is silver-white, 
a breath of frost. And some of us are gone.
 But he's here, the dark angel, 
everyone's last lover, up at the microphone
 singing Save the last dance for me;
 he's singing a cappella, the notes rising 
sweetly, yearningly toward the ceiling, 
which is now festooned with tissue flowers, 
paper streamers, balloons. 
And we're all eighteen again, 
lines and wrinkles erased, gray hairs gone, 
our slim bodies back, the perfect editing.
 A saxophone keens its reedy insistence; 
scents of gardenias and tea roses float in the air 
from our wrist corsages and boutonnieres. 
No children or lovers have broken our hearts, 
it's just all of us, together,
 in our fresh young skin, 
ready to do it all over again.

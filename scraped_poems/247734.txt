For Bernadette Mayer
Just one more vintage movie,
Batwings tonight at the Bal Masqué — 
Another creature stuffed
By distinguished pedigree.

I get a lot of madcap ideas about sentience,
How knowing has you put down in the book 
Forbidden speech recognition — 
Else why make such a face?

And now it's luck no longer mouth that moves
When fastidious rummage whispers
To divulge a surplus
A clue if not the key.

Prospect my question laps up for good — 
I lean to it. Knowing you,
First-person dwindle.
Tweet-tweet. Prick.

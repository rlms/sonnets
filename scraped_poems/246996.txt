I got a letter from the government.
It said let there be night.
I went through your trash.
There was night, all right.
I consider how your light is spent.

I have butterflies a little bit.
I have some pills I take for it.
I've been up since four the day before.
Agony's a cinch to sham.

Don't worry about the environment.
Let it kill us if â€Šit can.
I give a tiny tinker's damn.
I put the ox behind the cart.
Consume away my snow-blind heart.

Fastened to a service animal
it is waiting for the beep.
It is waiting for the right to change.
Hello, I know you're there, pick up.

So why assume [she]
 Is cold why not
 Assume drunk 
 “Legless”
 Can keep up pretty good though
 With your car in the rural night
 You are a passenger
 Your left leg lolls and
 Your friend reaches a hand
 Across the emergency brake
 Which points now at the base of
 The gearstick shaft
 And can point at its head
 But nowhere else
 Thus does not
 “Speak”
 And unless overused abused is
 Reliable
 Whereas anyone can misunderstand
 Or willfully misinterpret the
 Point and represent
 Are very different (Moon!)
 6am and the snow
 Sent enough light upward
 For this window to 
 Transmit and permit
 My seeing
 I heard more than I saw
 I understood less than I heard
 I was well read compared to
 But not compared to
 I begin to feel warm in 
 My crotch, as if a wodge
 Of moist electric blanket
 Were stuck in there
 And my friend was not
 Riding on the other side of the brake
 —I mean emergency—he is not
 Fox-hunting and on 
 A horse in a novel
 In which the brake
 Is a strip of greenwood
 He is downstairs  the coffee's
 Made  but he ignores
 My text   He works alone
 And I will have to go down there

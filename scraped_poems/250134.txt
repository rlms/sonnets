I almost insist on the words
                                                 as doors left swinging
 
from the force no one saw
 
                                             A wrap around hotel
 
                                             with empty courtyard
 
                                             boarded up, sprayed white
 
                    Hiding Out.
 
      Nick is too kind
                                   two black
                          and slowly moving marbles against flesh
 
Sara, a model of containment
 
                                             Brian is luminous (all eyes)
               
                             twin fires beyond the pit
                                                                            that only crackles green
 
                              brighter than the edges of the neon
                                                                                               lining Fairfax
 
                                                                          Family Books
 
                                                                                                    The Films of Robert Blake
 
                                                                                                             We score a trim ocean blue
                                                                               
                                                                                           windbreaker
 
                                      and Dinosaurs of the Land, Sea & Air
 
I slipped away from the bench
                                                       when they brought
                                                                               the car around
 
My black hobo sack abandoned
 
and thought a bomb. I was seamlessly high on my air heels and driven
 
                                          away to where the camera could not follow

Even the gun shows are gone now, even 
the scrapyards, the darkest, farthest barns. 
The strip mall half empty since 
my elementary years abides only 
chemicals now, the lot sequestered 
behind fences, its metal tanks checked 
each September for leaks in the seals. 
I lost my virginity in a basement here, lost
my balance on a backhoe, had to pick 
the gravel out of my knees. For the prom, 
my date was the tank man just vaporized
in the heat storm, his data screen open 
to augmented porn. This morning
in my Honda pedi-plane, I flew over where 
we used to sled, old hills oranged now
for warning, only the edges still brown. 
I saw a denier sitting outside 
in a lawn chair, her hair so long 
it met the ground. There's no idling in
the skyways now, which is why 
I can't tell you if she was dying.

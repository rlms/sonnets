I like old photographs of relatives   
in black and white, their faces set like stone.   
They knew this was serious business.   
My favorite album is the one that's filled   
with people none of us can even name.   

I find the recent ones more difficult.   
I wonder, now, if anyone remembers   
how fiercely I refused even to stand   
beside him for this picture — how I shrank   
back from his hand and found the other side.   

Forever now, for future family,   
we will be framed like this, although no one   
will wonder at the way we are arranged.   
No one will ever wonder, since we'll be   
forever smiling there — our mouths all teeth.

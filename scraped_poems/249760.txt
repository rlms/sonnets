If you come to Mojacar
and peel open an orange full of worms,
count how many there are because
those are the days it will take for your body
to decompose after you are buried.

If you come to Mojacar 
and find a small green snake with its back 
broken, don't step on it or you'll cause 
an earthquake that will catch up to you 
while you sleep in a continent far, far away.

If you come to Mojacar
 and two brown long-legged spiders crawl 
on your face and shoulders, keep a sharp eye 
out for two individuals, a mother-son, or 
sister-sister who will try to take your money.

If you come to Mojacar
and see a scorpion scurry by your feet,
note the direction it ran to, north, south, 
east, or west. You must avoid going there 
or risk the sting of losing a loved one.

If you come to Mojacar
and a cock crows ten times at three
in the morning, lock your door and all
the wooden windows because nightmares in silver
dresses will arrive to slip into your bed.Â

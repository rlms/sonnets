Pity the bathtub that belongs to the queen its feet 
Are bronze casts of the former queen's feet its sheen 
A sign of fretting is that an inferior stone shows through 
Where the marble is worn away with industrious

The maid thinks otherwise she knows the king 
Does not grip the queen nightly in his arms there are 
Others the queen does not have lovers she obeys 
Her mother once told her your ancestry is your only

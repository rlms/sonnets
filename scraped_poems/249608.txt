It was the sort of thing given to little girls: 
sturdy and small, round edged, wooden and light.
 I stalked the pasture's rough and waist-high grass
 for worthy specimens: the belle amid the mass, 
the star shaming the clouds of slighter, 
ordinary blooms. The asters curled 

inside my sweat-damp palms, as if in sleep. Crushed
 in the parlor's stifling heat, I pried 
each shrinking petal back, and turned the screws. 
But flowers bear no ugly bruise, 
and even now fall from the brittle page, dried 
prettily, plucked from memory's hush.

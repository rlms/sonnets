The woman with the microphone sings to hurt you,
To see you shake your head. The mic may as well
 Be a leather belt. You drive to the center of town
 To be whipped by a woman's voice. You can't tell
 The difference between a leather belt and a lover's
 Tongue. A lover's tongue might call you bitch,
 A term of endearment where you come from, a kind
 Of compliment preceded by the word sing

when shall your wounds
welcome their scabs?

daily your kingdom squeaks
and leaps to the starlight

it wants all of you
you of all and the music

of the pastures of midnoon
a little boy's kaleidoscopticon

you are the one the music
has chosen and whom strings call

twilight moans behind you
all you are you are all

it is the boy in black talking
how civil is the civil war?

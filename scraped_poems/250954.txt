The town's trees, roomy with winter, have begun 
of late to fill with them, a settling 
that commences with dusk. The widows complain —

claim they can smell them, can hear them shuffling 
in the trees, a wing hitting a branch a sound 
sharp, they say, as ice cracking. They cannot 

sleep. And so you form a committee, convening 
with shotguns to fire every night into the darkling 

congregation. Every night, the air resounds 
with that resolve, and every dusk they return 
with theirs, circle, a lazy familiar vortex 

around a drain, an old appointment they keep 
with an inescapable place; this argument 
no way, Claude says, to be any less afraid.

Not forced to fall for hideous Phaon,
 nor to drift dreamlike from
 a Victorian cliff, pursued by visions 
of slender limbs, peach-soft hair, 
dewy violets clustered 
in an unwilling lap, not exiled 
on a distant island for writing 
smartly about love, not called amoral 
nor forgotten, not murdered 
by a jealous lover, nor weakened 
from drink, did not make an incision
 in the veins, never murdered 
in a tavern at twenty-nine 
nor thought mad, released immediately 
from St. Luke's Hospital for Lunatics,
 freed from Northampton 
General Lunatic Asylum, 
cured of syphilis, not mad 
nor ruined by drink nor shot
 in the head, the rope unknotted 
and fluidly slid from the lamp-
post, sauntered away with a sideways 
crawl up the Champs-Élysées, 
never sickened from drink 
nor drowned in the Gulf of Spezia, 
the heart kept tight swam madly 
toward shore, disappeared down 
the glistening beach skipping 
happily in the direction of England,
 staved off fever while fighting 
for Greeks, lived, wrote, erased
 the blood-stained pillowcase, married Fanny, 
moved to Finland, fathered several 
pink-skinned children, lay down for a rest 
in the Baltimore street, got up 
confused about Spanish port and 
went to the graveyard to sleep it off,
 laudanum, opium, stroke, paralysis, 
aphasia, angels, threads of exotic Delacroix 
visions, but everything was put right 
when mom said, "Come on home, 
I want to care for you," left the house 
and walked into the river until 
the water level covered the hairline 
then shed the heavy Edwardian garments 
and broke into a birdlike breaststroke
 exclaiming, "How lovely to be free 
of the sickbed!" never destroyed by drink, 
sang while removing the shrapnel from 
a soldier, recovered from the Spanish flu, 
returned to Poland all debts forgiven 
by appreciative readers from the Congo, 
replaced the bottle of Lysol among toxic 
rats enjoying a sauna under the sink,
 did not pull the trigger or push the chair
out from under the revolution 
while screaming about the army of the arts, 
put on a jacket and sailed to Mexico, 
calmly came up on deck, folded
 the jacket over the rail, and then— 
arrested by a vision of spread-eagled sailors 
descending like angels through 
the turquoise sky—decided not 
to swallow the sea, freed from Payne Whitney, 
walked right on through the psychiatric 
state hospital and out the other side, 
had no psychotic break while on acid
 in a land of dreamlike torch singers 
masquerading as Satanists, never touched the stuff, 
the dead liver tissue miraculously mended, 
smoker's cough silenced, cured by the sea air 
of old gray Gloucester, jumped into 
the beach taxi and drove down the beach 
gesticulating gaily toward the setting sun,
 not undone, unloved, forgotten, nor
 filled with despair, not punished for talking 
with angels, not unhappy nor alone, 
not misrepresented nor misunderstood 
nor nauseous from drink or drugs or depression, 
loved respected and read
 long-lived healthy and happy 
celebrated by all in life before
 dying contented in a comfortable bed.

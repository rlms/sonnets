He falls abruptly silent when we fling 
A basket down or bang the dryer shut, 
But soon takes up again where he left off. 
Swept by a rainstorm through a narrow trough
 Clotted with cobwebs into Lord knows what 
Impenetrable murk, he's undeterred— 
You'd think his dauntless solo was a chorus, 
This rusty sump, a field or forest spring. 
And there is something wondrous and absurd 
About the way he does as he is bidden 
By instinct, with his gift for staying hidden 
While making sure unseen is plainly heard.
 
All afternoon his tremolo ascends 
Clear to the second story, where a girl 
Who also has learned blithely to ignore us 
Sings to herself behind her bedroom door. 
Maybe she moves to her invented score 
With a conductor's flourish, or pretends 
She's a Spanish dancer, lost in stamp and whirl 
And waving fan—notes floating, as she plays, 
Through the open window where the willow sways 
And shimmers, humming to another string. 
There is no story where the story ends. 
What does a singer live for but to sing?

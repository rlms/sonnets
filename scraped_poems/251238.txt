Was it like lifting a veil
And was the grass treacherous, the green grass

Did you think of your own mother

Was it like a virus
Did the software flicker

And was this the beginning
Was it like that

Was there gas station food

and was it a long trip


And is there sun there

or drones
or punishment
or growth


Was it a blackout


And did you still create me
And what was I like on the first day of my life


Were we two from the start
And was our time an entrance

or an ending


Did we stand in the heated room
Did we look at the painting

Did the snow appear cold
Were our feet red with it, with the wet snow

And then what were our names
Did you love me or did I misunderstand


Is it terrible


Do you intend to come back

Do you hear the world's keening

Will you stay the night

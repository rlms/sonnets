                           I

Arch inverted: white peony 
and stamens, yellow. Center 
of the body. Imagines. 
Who is absent.

Fingers in my mouth—memory. 
Dragonfly so blue in the head.
 Orange, as fire, in the body.

Wings, transparence. Disappearing arms.

The space where he was. Aureole. 
The space he is, she was. 
And the opposite.

Defines the dragon which flies.
 Iridescent where it was.
 Echo of hued wings.                 

                           II

Heat at the center. 
Heat where she was. 
Lack of passion 
where the torso
won't go. No path 
through what is occupied. 
Space.

                           III

Falls in a delicate arch, sees 
own soul. Cadaver as shrine,
 concavity.

So white. Says white flesh 
and no spirit.

And touching the dead.
 And touching what is not.

                           IV

In our calculations: the fact of matter
at lack of matter. The invisible, collapsed star.
If you must, a black hole. Thus the message of blackness
clearly indicating the coordinates of nothingness.

                           V

Remembers the pilgrimage
 to the illumined wall.

And Christ's face 
was said to appear. 
God's face. Who sees it?
 Child trying, trying.

Says to the child
 (and it is the juncture) 
go toward faith, 
go through absence, 
way to belief.

                           VI

(Not believing. Not seeing
and not believing. All the chants
to atmosphere, blanks.)

                           VII

Implodes, and all the way to nothing. 
To illumine, first, then fades to black. 
Hole where light was.
 Absent star, perforation in there.

And memory of light, halo on. 
Angels who walk among. 
Seeming darkness around the head.

                           VIII 

Falling languid. Lover not there.

                           IX

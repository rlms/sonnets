“In warm sunlight jade   
engenders smoke”; poetry,   
like indigo mountain, 
keeps its distance; 

the light plays words   
and figures, stone's   
edge edged with air,   
green haze growing. 

Amused by butterflies,   
Chuang Tsu dreaming,   
the emperor's heart in 
spring, thoroughly transformed. 

Still, in pieces, the words   
rest so much apart.   
Risking my life I lean   
on dangerous railings. 


When the dream wakes   
to its own particulars,   
the strands scattered,   
loose hair on muslin, 

broken characters 
the reeds make, unmake— 
vague    no reason 
bright    again    dark—

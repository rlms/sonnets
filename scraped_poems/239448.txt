The cat wants to be a strong thingâ€”a hand, a tree. 
The girl wants to be a pirate, in a tree. 
The tree wants to be the pond with its face of shining. 
The pond wants to be the sun who dumps its sugar on the grass. 
The grass wants to be the foot, its sole, its heel. 
The foot wants to be the brain who always gets to choose. 
The brain wants to be the feet dumb in their shoes.
The shoe wants to be the buckle that the girl shines with a cloth. 
The buckle wants to be the magpie lifting what shines. 
The magpie wants to be the egg in the nest touching its brother. 
The egg wants to be the feather. 
The feather wants to be the mite, devouring its plume.

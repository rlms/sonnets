In kindergarten during the Cold War, 
mid-day late bells jolted us, 
sending us single file into the hallway, 
where we sat, pressing our heads
 between our knees, waiting. 

During one of the bomb drills, 
Annette was standing. 
My mother said I would talk on and on 
about her, about how pretty she was. 
I still remember her that day, 
curly hair and pretty dress, 
looking perturbed the way 
little children do. 
Why Annette? There's nothing
 to be upset about— 
The bombs won't get us, 
I've seen what's to come— 
it is the days, the steady 
pounding of days, like gentle rain, 
that will be our undoing.

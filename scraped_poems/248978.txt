Frères humains qui après nous vivez,
Soon they'll have the speed freak twisting
On a scaffold, soon the birds
Will come to peck out his eyes, & when
He's too weak & exhausted to turn
His head away, they'll do it, too,
They'll peck his eyes right out.
You'll want to watch it happen, you'll want
To witness it. You'll want to see Paolo
And Francesca almost touch before
They're swept away again, him in one line
Waiting for rations, her in another one,
Both of  them naked, standing there,
Cock & nipples shriveled in the cold.

Frères humains qui après nous vivez,
N'ayez les cœurs contre nous endurcis.

We like to think
that the mind 
controls the body.

We send the body on a mission.

We don't feel the body,
but we receive conflicting reports.

The body is catching flak
or flies.

The body is sprouting grapefruit.

The body is under-
performing in heavy 
trading.

Reception is spotty.

Someone “just like me”
is born
in the future
and I don't feel a thing?

Like only goes so far.

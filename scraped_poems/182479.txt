Those 
various sounds, consistently indistinct, like intermingled echoes 
   struck from thin glasses successively at random— 
       the inflection disguised: your hair, the tails of two 
   fighting-cocks head to head in stone— 
       like sculptured scimitars repeating the curve of your    
               ears in reverse order:    
                                                                        your eyes, 
             flowers of ice and snow 

sown by tearing winds on the cordage of disabled ships: your 
       raised hand 
an ambiguous signature: your cheeks, those rosettes 
   of blood on the stone floors of French châteaux, 
with regard to which the guides are so affirmative— 
          your other hand 

a bundle of lances all alike, partly hid by emeralds from Persia 
    and the fractional magnificence of Florentine 
       goldwork—a collection of little objects— 
sapphires set with emeralds, and pearls with a moonstone, made fine 
   with enamel in gray, yellow, and dragonfly blue; 
      a lemon, a pear 

and three bunches of grapes, tied with silver: your dress, a magnificent square 
cathedral tower of uniform 
   and at the same time diverse appearance—a 
species of vertical vineyard, rustling in the storm 
   of conventional opinion—are they weapons or scalpels? 
       Whetted to brilliance 

by the hard majesty of that sophistication which is superior to opportunity, 
these things are rich instruments with which to experiment. 
    But why dissect destiny with instruments 
    more highly specialized than the components of destiny 
            itself?

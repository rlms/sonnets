Close to the
door in
my dream the
small signs

I saw a brown
sign with wisdom
on it
I saw a brown
one leaning
with wisdom
on it

fringe of a mirror
my mother 
leaning over a pond
cupping water

leaning against
the moulding
cardboard or 
wood which materials do you

does your wisdom prefer

which a-
partment in a summer
with someone 
I felt brave to
have touched 
her love the screen
door and the dogs
and the cats always
getting out. That
was the fear
two signs
fading but recalling
they had faded like words
fade in stone because
of the rain and the days
and waking and the dream
is leaving with every
step leaning over the meat
because I do not want 
you to have died in vain
kissing the turkey and 
the neck ofâ€Š my dog
all animals am I. 
all dreams, all stone
all message am I.

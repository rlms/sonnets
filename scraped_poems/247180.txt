One evening in winter 
when nothing has been enough, 
when the days are too short,

the nights too long 
and cheerless, the secret 
and docile buds of the apple

blossoms begin their quick 
ascent to light. Night 
after interminable night

the sugars pucker and swell 
into green slips, green 
silks. And just as you find

yourself at the end 
of winter's long, cold 
rope, the blossoms open

like pink thimbles 
and that black dollop 
of shine called

bumblebee stumbles in.

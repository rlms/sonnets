Elizabeth Bishop leaned on a table, it cracked, 
both fell to the floor. A gesture 
gone sadly awry. This was close to fact 
and quickly became symbolic, bound to occur 
in Florida, where she was surrounded 
by rotting abundance and greedy insects. 
One moment a laughing smile, a graceful hand 
alighting on solid furniture, 
a casual shift of weight, 
the next, undignified splayed legs. 
The shell of the table 
proved to be stuffed with termite eggs. 
True, it was a fall from no great heightâ€”
merely the height of herself, 
and although the hollowed-out table failed, 
at least the floor held, 
though probably infested by termites as well, 
and possibly built on a latent sinkhole, 
how can you tell? 
And how could she, smiling and easy, 
arm moving without forethought and permission, 
have forgotten fear, apparently 
let go of a hard-learned lesson? 
Enter a room as though it is strange. 
What you recognize may have changed, 
or may change without warning. 
Trees fall in hurricanes 
and on windless mornings, 
breaching houses where people you knew 
have vanished or died or stopped loving you.

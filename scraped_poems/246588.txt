On the morning she became a young widow, 
my grandmother, startled by a sudden shadow, 
looked up from her work to see a hawk turn 
her prized rooster into a cloud of feathers. 
That same moment, halfway around the world 
in a Minnesota mine, her husband died,
buried under a ton of rockfall. 
She told me this story sixty years ago. 
I don't know if it's true but it ought to be. 
She was a hard old woman, and though she knelt 
on Sundays when the acolyte's silver bell 
announced the moment of Christ's miracle, 
it was the darker mysteries she lived by: 
shiver-cry of an owl, black dog by the roadside, 
a tapping at the door and nobody there. 
The moral of the story was plain enough: 
miracles become a burden and require a priest 
to explain them. With signs, you only need 
to keep your wits about you and place your trust 
in a shadow world that lets you know hard luck 
and grief are coming your way. And for that 
—so the story goes—any day will do.

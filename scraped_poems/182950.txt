The Tartar swept across the plain 

In their furs and silk panties 

Snub-nose monkey men with cinders for eyes 

Attached to their ponies like centaurs 

Forcing the snowy passes of the Carpathians 

Streaming from defiles like columns of ants 

Arraying their host in a vasty wheel 

White, gray, black and chestnut steeds 

10,000 each to a quadrant 

Turning, turning at the Jenuye's command 

This terrible pinwheel 

Gathering speed like a Bulgar dance 

Faster and faster 

Until it explodes, columns of horsemen 

Peeling away in all the four directions 

Hard across the puszta 

Dust from their hooves darkening the sky 

They fall upon village and town 

Like raptors, like tigers, like wolves on the fold 

Mauling the zsa-zsas 

And leaving them senseless in puddles of goaty drool 

Smashing balalaikas 

Ripping the ears off hussars and pissing in the wounds 

They for whom the back of a horse 

Is their only country 

For whom a roof and four walls is like unto a grave 

And a city, ptuh, a city 

A pullulating sore that exists to be scourged 

Stinky dumb nomads with blood still caked 

On shield and cuirass 

And the yellow loess from the dunes of the Takla Makan 

And the Corridor of Kansu 

Between their toes and caught in their scalps 

Like storm clouds in the distance 

Fast approaching 

With news of the steppes, the lagoons and Bitter Lakes 

Edicts, torchings, infestation 

The smoke of chronicles 

Finding their way by the upper reaches 

Of the Selinga and the Irtysh 

To Issyk-Kul, the Aral, and then the Caspian 

Vanquishing the Bashkirs and Alans 

By their speed outstripping rumor 

Tireless mounts, short-legged and strong 

From whose backs arrows are expertly dispatched 

As fast as they can be pulled from the quiver 

Samarkand, Bukhara, Harat, Nishapur 

More violent in every destruction 

This race of men which had never before been seen 

With their roving fierceness 

Scarcely known to ancient documents 

From beyond the edge of Scythia 

From beyond the frozen ocean 

Pouring out of the Caucasus 

Surpassing every extreme of ferocity 

From the Don to the Dniester 

The Black Sea to the Pripet Marshes 

Laying waste the Ostrogoth villages 

Taking with them every last cookie 

Then dicking the help 

These wanton boys of nature 

Who shot forward like a bolt from on high 

Routing with great slaughter 

All they could come to grips with 

In their wild career 

Their beautiful shifting formations 

Thousands advancing at the wave of a scarf 

Then doubling back or making a turn 

With their diabolical sallies and feints 

Remorseless and in poor humor 

So they arrived at the gates of Christendom

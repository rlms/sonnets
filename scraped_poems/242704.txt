The letter said you died on your tractor 
crossing Shoal Creek. 
There were no pictures to help the memories fading 
like mists off the bottoms that last day on the farm 
when I watched you milk the cows, 
their sweet breath filling the dark barn as the rain 
that wasn't expected sluiced through the rain gutters. 
I waited for you to speak the loud familiar words 
about the weather, the failed crops— 
I would have talked then, too loud, stroking the Holstein 
moving against her stanchion— 
but there was only the rain on the tin roof, 
and the steady swish-swish of milk into the bright bucket 
as I walked past you, so close we could have touched.

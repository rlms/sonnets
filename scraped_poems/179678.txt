                      A friend calls, so I ask him to stop by.   
We sip old Scotch, the good stuff, order in, 
some Indian—no frills too fine for him 
or me, particularly since it's been 
                                       ages since we made the time. 

                      Two drinks in, we've caught up on our plans. 
I've sleepwalked through the last few years by rote; 
he's had a nasty rough patch, quote unquote, 
on the home front. So, we commiserate, 
                                       cupping our lowballs in our hands.   

                        It's great to see him, good to have a friend 
who feels the same as you about his lot— 
that, while some grass is greener, your small plot 
is crudely arable, and though you're not 
                                       so young, it's still not quite the end.   

                      As if remembering then, he spills his news. 
Though I was pretty lit, I swear it's true, 
it was as if a gold glow filled the room 
and shone on him, a sun-shaft piercing through 
                                       dense clouds, behind which swept long views. 

                      In that rich light, he looked not like my friend 
but some acquaintance brushed by on the train. 
Had his good fortune kept me from the same, 
I had to wonder, a zero-sum game 
                                       that gave the night its early end? 

                      Nothing strange. Our drinks were done, that's all. 
We haven't spoken since. By morning, I 
couldn't remember half of what the guy 
had said, just his good news, my slurred goodbye, 
                                       the click of the latch, the quiet hall.

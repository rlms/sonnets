So populous the region
That from the next region
The crowing of children, barking of cars could be heard,
So that a continuous linkage
Of sounds of living ran
In the limber air,
District to district, Woodlake to Montclair,
Freestone to Smithfield, and one child's cry
Was not concealed from any trade route,
Or passer by,
Or upstairs island of thought withdrawn, 
Or basement of submerged magnificence.
One crow
Welkened the evening sky,
Bark blasted the dark,
Like an assertion in a time of assent,
Or an increase to astonishment.

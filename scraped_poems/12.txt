You humble in. It's just as you remember: 
The sallow walls, formica counter top, 

The circular argument of time beneath 
Fluorescent flickering—doubt, faith, and doubt. 

She knows you've been to see the gilded girl 
Who's always promising and walking out 

With someone else. She knew that you'd return, 
With nothing in your pockets but your fists. 

Why do you resist? When will you learn 
That this is what your weary dreams are of— 

Succumbing to Her unconditional love?

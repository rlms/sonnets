His new hip healed in, we're working 
on a bluff, talking doctors and health care 
reform as we shove a new propane tank into place. 
A shape on the surface catches his eye: 
"Right whale," he says, but I can only see
 endless swells rolling in from the east.
 He points out the gradations of gray 
and green that mark deep ledge, the tide's 
shape along the islands and rocks,
 the whale's glistening back suddenly in focus.
 I react with the same surprise
 my patients feel when I observe 
what they can't seeâ€” 
a sudden shift in gaze, or a crease in a cheek, 
understanding how a doctor becomes 
like a man who has spent sixty years 
on a lobster boat, watching the world 
swim fast and shining, right before his eyes.

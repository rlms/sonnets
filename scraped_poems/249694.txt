Back in those days, when he told me about his adventures
 in sex clubs it wasn't the whys and wherefores

but technical details, like going rafting
 down the Colorado River; and when he wrote

about a gay male friend whose first sexual experience 
was with his stepfather, the friend told him

it wasn't weird, but the best possible thing
that could have happened . . . I saw then that God,

who I never believed in, was dwelling in my heart 
as a negative: that the negative had been developed

into a picture of a man who stares up at the sky
on a day so clear he sees through the mountain's shadows

to the divinely human-seeming form that climbs it— 
a neighbor in running shoes and sunglasses

jogging up the slope with his dog, tongue panting
 and slavering, an acute look of happiness in its eyes

that could turn at any moment into exhaustion or pain 
as in a maze of cubicles called Asshole Alley, little pyramids

of canvas called Lust of the Pharaohs, different pricing
 for what you want, depending on the equipment,

the air thick with a sour, acidic, head-fogging reek 
of come. . . . And my pal the poet, who believed

in infernal chemistry, in the spirit as a kind 
of "spooky action at a distance," he communed

with this God, this eternally dying father of all matter 
who made out of our bodies his own maze of cubicles

where he hides himself away—his sanctuary 
Asshole Alley where God's own unholy loves

bubble all around him like a cauldron in his ears— 
and my poet pal heard the bubbling, he stirred

the pot, he showed me the holy city, the sexual New Jerusalem
 that came prepared as a bride adorned for her husband . . .

—That was how it was in those days, back when my friend 
hadn't yet met the coroner who wrote down

his cause of death as "polysubstance abuse"
that brought on his heart attack while fucking . . .

And regardless if I believed, whenever 
we were together God shone clearer—

those were the days when every morning God woke up 
in a blur of ecstasy and went to bed every night

in divine rage. Whoever loved him, 
he loved. Whoever hated him,

he hated back: for who can doubt the vitality 
of hate or the volatility of love.

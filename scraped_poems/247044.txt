1. deathbed

There is a word that is not water, 
has nothing to do with heat or light, 
is unrelated to any one pain 
though the torn body tears itself further 
trying to speak it.
                                  There is a sound 
beyond all the sounds that I have made, 
the needs that one by one I've tried to name. 
It burns clear in the eyes searching mine, 
the lips beginning to bleed again, 
her hand squeezing my hand, 
pleading and pleading that I understand.


2. living will

All afternoon in the afterlife 
of little things that love,
 or pain, or need could not let go of
 I hunt for the will
 that will let me let you go.

I am distracted and slow—
all the grainy faces
 in old photographs, letters 
from the dead, deeds to places 
that are only air,

 some bright nowhere 
of broad fields and sunlight 
that was my idea of heaven 
one long afternoon 
of clouds and steady rain

 when you sat and explained 
where a garden was, a well, 
excited by it, the hell 
ahead of you 
just a brief tightness at your heart.

 Outside in the yard, crickets start, 
cry here and here and here,

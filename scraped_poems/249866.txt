It's mostly someone
long dead who gets curious
all over again, who once told
a book, the book
picked clean to glow
on a website now, an address
with double slashes in it.

Suddenly I love
one detail: the way they harnessed
horses or hammered
copper, what seed — cardamom, rye — 
kept its small heart aloft
for a millennium.

Voices in that
dark ago when I open
to room light, lamp
or window on book — old friend — 
or the new computer screen.

It's not technology, either way.
It's something
in the brain first, an inkling. Not yet
yours to know.

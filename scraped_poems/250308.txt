Complex amaryllis — two-faced,
multiflorus, wrath-spathed ball of
ire — grows flagrantly unfragrant.
Pulp-fiery the take-no-prisoners
Haemanthus. Bully! Bully!
Bully the bloodflower! (Blood-
thirsty suffice it to suffuse.)
Transfuse the lily-livered,
the raging un-aromatic, the
arrogant blood-rivering spleen.

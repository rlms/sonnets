If you stand on the corner
of Mabini Street and Legazpi Avenue,
wait for an orchid colored mini-bus
with seven oblong doors,
open the fourth door—

an oscillating electric fan 
will be driving, tell her to proceed
 to the Escolta diamond district— 
you will pass Maneng Viray's Bar, 
La Isla de los Ladrones book shop,

the Frederick Funston fish sauce factory, 
and as you turn left into Calle de Recuerdos,
 you will see Breton, Bataille, and Camus 
seated around a card table playing 
abecedarian dominoes—

roll down your window and ask 
them if Mr. Florante and Miss Laura
are home, if the answer is, yes,
then proceed to Noli Me Tangere park
and wait for a nun named Maria Clara—

if the answer is, Je ne se pas!, then turn
right onto the parking lot of Sikatuna's
supermarket to buy a basketful
of lansones fruit, then get back
to Calle de Recuerdos until you reach

the part that's lined with tungsten-red 
Juan Tamad trees, on the right will be 
a house with an acknowledgments page 
and an index, open the door and enter 
this page and look me in the eye.

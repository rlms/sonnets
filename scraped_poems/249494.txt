Says fifty-four-year-old obese Hispanic
female — I wonder if they mean the one
with long black braids, Peruvian, who sells 
tamales at the farmers' market, tells
me I'm too thin, I better eat; or is
she the Dominican with too much rouge
and almond eyes at the dry cleaner's who
must have been so beautiful in her youth;
or maybe she's the Cuban lady drunk
on grief who I've seen half-asleep, alone
as if that bench were only hers, the park
her home at last; or else the Mexican
who hoards the littered papers she collects
and says they are her “documents”; if not,
it could be that Colombian drug addict
whose Spanish, even when she's high, is perfect;
or maybe it's the one who never says
exactly where she's from, but who reminds
me of my grandmother, poor but refined,
lace handkerchief balled up in her plump hand,
who died too young from a condition that
some doctor, nose in her chart, overlooked.

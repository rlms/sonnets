In Tucson 
when a university student
 goes home 
she might leave her desk 
and a chair, a bookcase outside her cave 
with a sign, “Take me.” 

And who could resist 
heat radiating over furniture 
like a mirage? You hoist 
an old Victrola into your pickup 
and ratchet up a new song. 

You start that life in the West, 
invent a past, and when that tune 
winds down, it's okay to put out, 
“Take me.” 

What do we have in life
 but comings and goings?

By the time we got out on the water 
the sun was so low, it wasn't like water

but a field of gray snow that we plowed 
in one endless white furrow of water

as I skirted the rocks and wrecked trawlers 
and abandoned old jetties just under the water,

while you moaned in the bow, slick with fever, 
whispering back to whatever the water

chattered and hissed through the hullâ€” 
until at last there were lights on the water

and I let the old Mercury rattle and sputter 
its steaming gray rainbows out onto the water

as we drifted, at idle, for the last time in your life, 
through that beloved, indifferent harbor.

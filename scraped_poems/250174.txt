From down the road, starting up
 and stopping once more, the sound 
of a puppy on a chain who has not yet 
discovered he will spend his life there.
 Foolish dog, to forget where he is 
and wander until he feels the collar 
close fast around his throat, then cry 
all over again about the little space
 in which he finds himself. Soon,
 when there is no grass left in it 
and he understands it is all he has, 
he will snarl and bark whenever
 he senses a threat to it. 
Who would believe this small 
sorrow could lead to such fury 
no one would ever come near him?

I want to be a passenger
 in your car again 
and shut my eyes 
while you sit at the wheel,

awake and assured
in your own private world,
seeing all the lines
on the road ahead,

down a long stretch 
of empty highway 
without any other 
faces in sight.

I want to be a passenger 
in your car again 
and put my life back 
in your hands.

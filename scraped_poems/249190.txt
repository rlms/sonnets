The lights in the theater fail. The long racks 
Of costumes abandoned by the other dancers 
Trouble Celeste. The conductor asks 
If she is sad because autumn is coming on,

But when autumn comes she is merely pregnant and bored. 
On her way back from the holidays, a man 
Who appears to have no face rattles the door 
To her compartment. How disgusting, she thinks; 

How disgusting it always must be to grow old.

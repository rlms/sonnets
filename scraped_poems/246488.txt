I can't swim because I can't fit
into the water

                         I am 
two million feet tall

but thank you for inviting me

I am standing in line
inside my giant shirt

If someone wanted to weaponize me
they would tell me to lie down on New York

and the city I destroyed
would hurt me back

I eat stars
                         It's a riot

I know
                         my big mouth
full of  their light

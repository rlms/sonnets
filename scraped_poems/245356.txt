The anthology of love poems I bought
for a quarter is brittle, anyway, and comes 
apart when I read it.

One at a time, I throw pages on the fire 
and watch smoke make its way up
and out.

I'm almost to the index when I hear
a murmuring in the street. My neighbors 
are watching it snow.

I put on my blue jacket and join them. 
The children stand with their mouths 
open.




I can see nouns—longing, rapture, bliss—

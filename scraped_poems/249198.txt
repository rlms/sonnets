None of the streets here has a name,
but if I'm lost
tonight I'm happy to be lost.

Ten million lanterns light the Seoul avenues
for Buddha's Birthday,
ten million red blue green silver gold moons

burning far as the eye can see in every direction
& beyond,
“one for every spirit,”
voltage sizzling socket to socket
as thought does,
firing & firing the soul.

Lashed by wind, flying up like helium balloons 
or hanging still 
depending on weather,

they turn each road into an earthly River of Heaven 
doubling & reversing 
the river above,

though not made of much:
some colored paper, glue, a few wires,
a constellation of poor facts.

I can't help feeling giddy.
I'm drunk on neon, drunk on air,
drunk on seeing what was made
almost from nothing: if anything's here at all
it was built
out of ash, out of the skull-rubble of war,

the city rising brick by brick
like a shared dream,
every bridge & pylon & girder & spar a miracle,

when half a century ago
there was nothing
but shrapnel, broken mortar-casings, corpses,

the War Memorial in Itaewon counting 
More than 3 Million Dead, or Missing— 
still missed by the living, still loved beyond reason,

monument to the fact
that no one can hurt you, no one kill you
like your own people.

I'll never understand it.
I wonder about others I see on the sidewalks,
each soul fathomless—

strikers & scabs walking through Kwanghwamoon,
or “Gate of Transformation by Light,”
riot police rapping nightsticks against plexiglass-shields,

hawkers haggling over cell phones or silk shirts, 
shaking dirt from chamae & bok choi, 
chanting price after price,

fishermen cleaning tubs of cuttlefish & squid,
stripping copper carp,
lifting eels or green turtles dripping from tanks,

Hanyak peddlars calling out names of cures
for sickness or love—
crushed bees, snake bile, ground deer antler, chrysanthemum root,

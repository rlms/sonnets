I thought we were playing a game
in a forest that day.
I ran as my mother chased me.

But she'd been stung by a bee.
Or bitten by a snake. 
She shouted my name, which

even as a child I knew was not
“Stop. Please. I'm dying.” 

I ran deeper 
into the bright black trees
happily
as she chased me: How 

lovely the little bits and pieces. 
The fingernails, the teeth. Even
the bombed cathedrals
being built inside of me. 

How sweet 
the eye socket. The spine. The
curious, distant possibility that God
had given courage 
to human beings
that we might 
suffer a little longer.

And by the time 

I was willing to admit that
all along
all along
I'd known it was no game

I was a grown woman, turning 
back, too late.

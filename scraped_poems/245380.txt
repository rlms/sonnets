pigs prey to piggishnesses. get ate from the rooter to the tooter. 
I'm a hog for you baby, I can't get enough go the wolfish crooner. 
the gust buffeted porker roll in the hay or laid down 
              in twig rapine. let me in, let me in. 

              no drum-gut, Stagger's stomach a tenement: 
his deadeye bigger than his brick house. 
Stagger Lee live by the want and die by the noose, 
whose greedy void like a whorehouse 
              full of empties getting full. can't get enough! 
rumored Stagger would root through pussy 
to plumb a fat boy. here piggy! what Lee see he seize. 
manful, ham-fisted. sorry Billy, 
              your name mud and who love dirt like swine? 
they get in it like a straw house. it'll be cold out 
before Lee admit his squeals weren't howls. 
he got down. he get dirty.

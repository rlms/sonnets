is not a man being swallowed by a fish 
with eyes like eight-point throwing stars 
it's a man being swallowed by a war 
a man being taken into the mouth of a woman 
or being swallowed by his work

it's a man traveling far inside a book
a man being swallowed up in smoke
he swallows the smoke, that blends around him like a thought
it's a man being swallowed by a sound
he shapes it so he lives inside a song

of a man being swallowed by his kin, his skin 
a man being swallowed by the State 
(Leviathan in 1948)
It's a man being swallowed by another man 
literally, eaten as a pathway to god

it's a man being swallowed by a sight
he cannot reach, cannot touch, cannot trace

it's a man who won't recognize his face 
who can't fit the parts, or find the place

it's a man in triumph over death
who laughs and beats the dust from his clothes
a man tasting dust inside the laugh

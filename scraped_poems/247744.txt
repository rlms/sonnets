  A comped piano lifted the leaves in
    Low Forest, a blanket of shade pulled
up, a sheet of glass put in place, free
                                                                   pros-
    pect all around I thought. I wanted my
allegoric lapse, I wanted my whatsaid
  companions. Alone looking out under
                                                                        house
      arrest, I wanted them back, less myself
   than before, unbeset...    An exquisite jewel
    it all was, no explanation, no equation,
                                                                            a
   time-lapse excursion it was. High John
    from High Point was on the box, the box
blown roofless, hacked wood scattered
                                                                        what
   light there was...    A low trombone could
     be heard asking, “What have they done to
my beautiful boy?” A tree limb cracked in
                                                                             the
       distance, the all-of-us the horns had be-
  come. All of us there to notice, all of us there
    to see, “Blue Train” our wounded anthem,
hacked wood the woods we walked...    I was
                                                                               im-
     agining Sophia's dreamt-about blue truck,
       dreamt arrival, Trane's loud announcement
   a blur, train truck, wished-for congress come
                                                                                      nigh.
    There was the sun's late equation, the moon's
ludic blush, truck equaling train equaling train
   equaling truck, soon's blue transport, soon
                                                                                  soon
come...    It was the muse's blue lips the all-of-
     us the horns had become came thru, blue
  rebuked kiss, blue-blent reconnoiter. It was
                                                                                  the
      muse's gray canopy covered us, the we I'd
   otherwise be the trees fell free of, cries loud
     and low we'd have heard had we been there,
wood equaling would equaling we...    I lay
                                                                           like
   Anuncio busted up contemplating the book
     of it, last leg's no-exit announcement no way
to run. I stood like Itamar, sat like Huff. A
                                                                              sweet
    smile captured my lips like Netsanet's, Zeno
                                                                                     and
  Zenette's re-
pair


                          • 


  Zeno and Zenette's last anything. Zeno and
     Zenette's last kiss. I saw them come back 
from afar, saw them bisect every step. Friend
                                                                                   and
    familiar, affine, foe, they walked in smelling 
       of salt, the reek of  Lone Coast on their hair, 
   their skin, sand a kind of coat they wore...    
                                                                                Some-
       thing I saw it seemed I dreamt I saw, some-
   thing seen exteriority reneged on, stand up wide 
     awake though I did. Did I see what I saw I
                                                                                  won-
      dered, the closer the coast was the less I felt
   located, water opening out onto everywhere,
    was what I saw what I saw I wanted to know...    
A versionary recital it seemed or so I thought,
                                                                                    so
    abreast of it only the book of it remained, a
finger dipped in butterfly dust, a foot gone print- 
   less, what of it I glimpsed gone out on tiptoe,
                                                                                     wuh
      we'd have been whose escorts, wuh we, once
   there, drew thru the woods...    So it was or so
     it went, going so, soon gone, a blip no screen
accounted for, blink, as I did, all I could. The
                                                                                  box
       had fallen away, sound itself an overt bed of
   scree, roughed underbody I fell and felt heir
     to, a chestnut sense were there any sense left, a
                                                                                            new
   scrub sense of my-
self

    “Let it play on you,” Huff had said, “let 
it have its way.” I wasn't clear what “it” 
  was but my ears perked up. Mu, I knew, 
                                                                            had 
      gone into hiding and it might have been 
  Mu. I wondered was it Mu he spoke about... 
    In front of us the waves rolled in. They 
                                                                           gave 
  his eyes a glassy look... To see was to see 
      oneself suspended, round Insofarian bliss 
    at the foot of Mount Ida, Huff 's ythmic 
                                                                            what- 
  say, a smiling spider's 
bite

                                                                     was 
    too much. I saw a tiptoe ghost prome-

  Mr. and Mrs. P's reminiscent lament... 
                                                                          Some-

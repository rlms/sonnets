I will pull an airplane with my teeth
and I will pull an airplane with my hair.
I write about cats. Cats, when you read this, 
write about me. Be the change you want to see.

I've legally changed my name to Whites Only.
Changed it back, I should say.
DO NOT  TRY THIS AT HOME made me 
the man I am today.

That, and the University of  Phoenix.
Old man, take a look at my life.
Charles Simic, in the gloaming, with a roach,
take a look at my life. I'm a lot like you.

A man stands up and says I will catch
a bullet in my teeth! That's incredible!
He eats a sword, hilt first, and spits 
up a million people persons.

A dolphin pulls an airplane with its blowhole
and keeps the black box for itself.
Bottleneck dolphins don't even have bones, 
yet here we are, giving them medals ...    

This is my ass. And that is a hole
in ground zero. I know which is which.
It's the one with the smoke pouring out.
This is my handle; this is my spout.

Our sorrow had neither place nor carrier-away,
and dared not hover over the child
whose breath opened as transom
of a frail house.
Nor could we put our sorrow in the dictionary,
for ghastliness already shot out its own defining
in rags of fired light.
Pigeons would not sleek it
over their dirty coats, nor fly
sorrow against the aviary's sharp fence.
Each day bridgeless, each night birdless,
all the nocturnals needless at the expanse
of our nightwatch.
                                     But wake at the moon, 
we could, mumbling, are we 
in a horror show?—inside of sleep 
our shock-white minds caught on reels 
where a child's body breaks the heart 
and the mother can't know 
if she counts as a mother. I don't know 
if the child heard 
what wept at the bedside,
orderlies snapping smelling salts from chalky bullets
 against all the mothers falling,
 all the fathers under 
what each branch let down: 
there's a hidden weight to snow.

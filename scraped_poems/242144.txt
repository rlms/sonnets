I collect them now, it seems. Like 
sea-shells or old 
thimbles. One for 
Father. One for

Mother. Two for my sweet brothers. 
Odd how little 
they require of 
me. Unlike the

ones they were sent in memory 
of. No sudden 
shrilling of the 
phone. No harried

midnight flights. Only a little 
water now and 
then. Scant food and 
light. See how I've

brought them all together here in 
this shaded space 
beyond the stairs. 
Even when they

thirst, they summon me with nothing 
more than a soft, 
indifferent furl- 
ing of their leaves.ï»¿

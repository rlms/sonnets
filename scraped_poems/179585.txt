The screamer sleeps, inside. 
The desert's wide awake: 
the mouse, the rattlesnake. 
I've come out here to hide, 

behind our house, below 
the riddled sky, afraid 
of what our bodies made. 
To the south: Mexico... 

These are the nights men run. 
Guaymas before midday, 
a beach-town life...I play 
it out. Such things are done. 

The Rincons seep like a stain 
into the paling east. 
The borders are policed. 
The wail, nearby, of a train.

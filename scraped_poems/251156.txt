I staredat the white pills blankly for a long while, I even took a picture ofthem,  before  (finally, definitely)  throwing  them away.  I'd beensober  (again)  for  some years  when  I found that box,  but everyaddict  has  one— a  little  box,  metaphorical  or  actual— hiddenaway.  Before I flushed them  I held them in my palm,  marvelingthat  at  some  point in  the  not-so-distant  past it seemed a goodidea  to  keep a  stash of  pills on hand.  For an emergency, I toldmyself.  What kind of emergency? What  if  I needed  a root canalon  a  Sunday  night?  This little  box  would  see me through untilthe   dentist   showed   up  for   work  the  next  morning.  Half  mybrain  told  me  that,  while  the other half  knew that  looking intothat  box  was  akin  to  seeing  a photograph of myself standing onthe  edge of a bridge,  a bridge  in the  familiar  dark neighborhoodof  my  mind,   that   comfortable  place   where  I  could  somehowbelieve that fuck it was an adequate response to life.

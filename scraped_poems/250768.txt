                             and remote, and useful, 
if only to itself. Take the fly, angel 
of the ordinary house, laying its bright 
eggs on the trash, pressing each jewel out 
delicately along a crust of buttered toast. 
Bagged, the whole mess travels to the nearest
 dump where other flies have gathered, singing 
over stained newsprint and reeking
 fruit. Rapt on air they execute an intricate
 ballet above the clashing pirouettes
 of heavy machinery. They hum with life. 
While inside rumpled sacks pure white 
maggots writhe and spiral from a rip,
 a tear-shaped hole that drools and drips 
a living froth onto the buried earth. 
The warm days pass, gulls scree and pitch,
 rats manage the crevices, feral cats abandon
 their litters for a morsel of torn fur, stranded
 dogs roam open fields, sniff the fragrant edges,
 a tossed lacework of bones and shredded flesh.
 And the maggots tumble at the center, ripening,
 husks membrane-thin, embryos darkening
 and shifting within, wings curled and wet, 
the open air pungent and ready to receive them 
in their fecund iridescence. And so, of our homely hosts, 
a bag of jewels is born again into the world. Come, lost 
children of the sun-drenched kitchen, your parents 
soundly sleep along the windowsill, content, 
wings at rest, nestled in against the warm glass. 
Everywhere the good life oozes from the useless 
waste we make when we create—our streets teem 
with human young, rafts of pigeons streaming 
over the squirrel-burdened trees. If there is 
a purpose, maybe there are too many of us 
to see it, though we can, from a distance,
hear the dull thrum of generation's industry,
feel its fleshly wheel churn the fire inside us, pushing
the world forward toward its ragged edge, rushing
like a swollen river into multitude and rank disorder.
Such abundance. We are gorged, engorging, and gorgeous.

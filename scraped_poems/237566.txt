          Before the God-bullied hull, call me—
          Before the God-bullied hull buckles, before

          The red flag unfurled on water bucks and drowns,
          Before the sky-hawk dives down, before

          The nail drives through the sky-hawk's red-wing—
          Call me
                      the nail driven through the wing
          And call me the wing driven through.
                                                                A board
          On water is buoyant, I know: I cling to wood—
          A dictionary buckles and drowns. I know

          I do not drown: I'm abridged, afloat, call me—

Sir, when my book arrives, when each page
You've untied lets go the breath it held
That was my breath, then my breath will not be mine—
I think you'll know. I know when doors open
I mean to keep closed: study-door, desk-drawer.
My wife found the key I hid beneath the fern.
My pens she did not touch. She did not touch
The hundred pages I left blank to fill other days.
She took the cracked compass I keep for luck
(the needle's sharp, but stuck), took my green-glass
Ink-pot, and centering the compass on my desk,
Poured out each dark drop of ink unitl ink
Seeped through cracked glass and left the compass
Ink-full. The gold needle loosened, floated: a line.

          Bent back, I am taking you inside my head
          Turning back. Ahab bent

          The needle that refused North
                                                      back to a magnet's tow—
          Did, Ahab did, after
          The needle's faith answered our question: No.

          How do you point at a horizon? Ask me. I know.
          Needle out your arm: close eyes:

          And turn in a circle. Inscribe a zero on the wood-deck—
          The Equator on zero
                              latitudes lies. That is the truth, I know

Sir, what name that bay a last page carves
Out of no shore: ice? glacier? greenland?
strand, shoal-of-white-sand? an artic-calm?

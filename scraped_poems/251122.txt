Every spring my mother says I should buy a straw
 hat so I won't overheat in summer.

 I always agree but the valley's soon cold, and besides
 my old Borsalino is nearly rain-proof. 

She's at it again, it's August, the grapes are sugaring.
 I say, Okay, and pluck a little spider from her hairâ€” 

hair so fine it can't hold even one of her grandmother's
 tortoise shell combs.

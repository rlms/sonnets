The sky hangs up its starry pictures: a swan, 
a crab, a horse. And even though you're 
three hundred miles away, I know you see 
them, too. Right now, my side 
of the bed is empty, a clear blue lake 
of flannel. The distance yawns and stretches. 
It's hard to remember we swim in an ocean 
of great love, so easy to fall into bickering 
like little birds at the feeder fighting over proso 
and millet, unaware of how large the bag of grain is, 
a river of golden seeds, that the harvest was plentiful, 
the corn is in the barn, and whenever we're hungry,
 a dipperful of just what we need will be spilled . . .

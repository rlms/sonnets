The sea was one thing, once; the field another. Either way,
something got crossed, or didn't. Who's to say, about
happiness? Whatever country, I mean, where inconceivable
was a word like any other lies far behind me now. I've
learned to spare what's failing, if it can keep what's living
alive still, maybe just

the birds nest in, for example, not noticing the leaves, color
of surrender, color of poverty as I used to imagine it when
I myself was poor but had no idea of it. I've always thought
gratitude's the one correct response to having been made,
however painfully, to see this life more up close. The higher
gods having long refused me, let the gods deemed lesser
do the best they can

  The silence that was neither Spanish  nor English  was my prayer.                               —Luis Alberto Urrea 

1.
Last night I dreamt I was Pancho Villa—
ragged, bandoliered, reckless.
I dreamt my poetry at the end of a pistol,
felt it kick nearly out of my hand.

But this morning I awoke again
white and assimilated into these cobwebs
of my half-self. When did I forget
my mother? Sometimes Spanish

syllables creak like wobbly shopping cart 
wheels, I have to lean against accent,
fill myself with verbs: necesitar, hablar, poder.

2.
Half, medio, milkweed,
Carlos Gringo, Carlos Murphy.
Part mexicano,
part Kentucky hillbilly,
I've angloed my way
through this life—
hablando español 
de conveniencia,
nunca pensando en
la bendición.

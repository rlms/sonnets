I give a piece quite near away,
then another, one and two to three
and say good-bye with some dismay.

We might have been twins, I born in May
and she of the blistered January
colored like the vibrant cray-

on, clinging on to toys of the day,
as mine become that of history.
“Again,” she cries and I obey.

I hold the script of the gone by matinee:
before I ever found a scar, a yawn, a he;
past the years I've spun to macramé.

Soon I must go, and she will stay,
dwelling under the apple tree,
never to wander blind in first foray.

Sentient air, lead her not to disarray.
She flails. I walk. We are matching memory.
I have things she never will, a little say.
So I pull away and board the last ferry.

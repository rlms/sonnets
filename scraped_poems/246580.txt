Forgive us. We have dragged them into the night 
in taffeta dresses, in stiff collars and ties, 
with the wind damp, the sleet raking their cheeks,

to school lunchrooms fitted with makeshift stages 
where we will sit under bad fluorescent lighting 
on folding chairs, and they will sing and play.

We will watch the first grader with little cymbals, 
bending her knees, hunched in concentration 
while neighbors snicker at her ardent face.

Forgive us. We will hear the seventh-grade boy 
as his voice finally loses its innocence 
forever, at the unbearable solo moment

and know that now, for years, he will wince at the thought 
of singing, yet will ache to sing, in silence,
silence even to the generation to come

with its night, its sleet, its hideous lunchroom chairs.

An unexpected consequence
Of mine (and one that shows how well
It really went, in a scary sense)
Is at its most perceptible
When I happen to observe a nose
With the hump of  which my nose is rid
(Though not my psyche, you'd suppose)
And feel the sighting visited
By what a lord might call a kind
Of  pity: distant, tinged with scorn...
A thing you'd more expect to find
In someone to his beauty born.

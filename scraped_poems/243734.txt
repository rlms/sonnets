I tied it to your wrist
With a pretty pink bow, torn off
By the first little tug of wind.
I'm sorry.

I jumped to catch it, but not soon enough.
It darted away.

It still looked large and almost within reach.
Like a heart.

Watch, I said.
You squinted your little eyes.

The balloon looked happy, waving
Good-bye.

The sky is very high today, I said.
Red went black, a polka dot,

Then not. We watched it,
Even though we couldn't

Spot it anymore at all.
Even after that.

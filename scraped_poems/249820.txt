Where ever something breathes
Heart beating the rise and fall

Of seas, the terror is our ignorance, that's
Why it is named after our home, earth
Where art is locked between

Off the ground. Was he grateful, ask him he's still sitting up there
Watching the sky's adventures, leaving two holes for his own. Oh sing
Gigantic burp past the insects, swifter than the ugly Stanleys on the ground
Catching monkey meat for Hyenagators, absolute boss of what does not

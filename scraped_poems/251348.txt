On thin golden poles
 gliding up, sliding down,
 a kingdom of horses
 goes spinning around.
  
 Jumper, Brown Beauty,
 Dark Thunder, Sir Snow, 
 a medley of ponies
 parade in a row.
  
 Settled in saddles,
 their riders hold on
 to reins of soft leather
 while circling along
  
 on chestnut or charcoal,
 on sleek Arctic white,
 on silver they gallop
 in place day and night.
  
 Such spinning is magic,
 (to dream as you sail)
 with lavender saddle
 and ebony tail,
  
 whirling to music
 in moonlight, spellbound,
 galloping, galloping,
 merrily go round.

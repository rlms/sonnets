One way to draw France is in scallops:

Dunkirk to Brest,
Brest to Saint-Jean-de-Luz,

The imperceptible stone sag
of certain dolmens
over the Pyrenees between Saint-Jean

& Banyuls-sur-Mer

Then, to Nice

Nice, skirting the Alps to Lauterbourg

From Lauterbourg back
to where you began

For the meticulous, 
the additions of Cherbourg, Toulon, &
even Le Havre,

Maybe Givet

Yours is a green diorama
It contains several kilowatts of sun,
a superabundance of flowers

Men dress like they are perpetually
on their way to a funeral

White people,
their splotch-parchment cheeks

All those roast chickens, none with the fat 
trimmed from the rump

The lousy job my father lands
I'm tickled pink to celebrate.
My mother's rosary-pinching hands
stack pigs in blankets on a plate.

Teeny uncircumcised Buddha penises
(cocktail hot dogs in strips of dough):
I gobble these puffed-up weenie geniuses
as if they'd tell me what I need to know

to get the fuck out of here.
They don't only stink of fear.
They're doom and shame and dumb pig fate.
I tell my mom I think they're great.

Dad chews his slowly with a pint of gin,
and says he eats a whole shit deal
because of us. My mom's in tears again.
I don't know who to hate or how to feel.

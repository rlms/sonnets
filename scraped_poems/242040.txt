A branch, the hand of Apollo,The plane tree's polished, broad bough,Spread above you, may it bring youThe universe's immortal peace.
You'd meet me on the broad and shining shore
            Of Pylos, so I'd planned,
With Mentor's tall ship pulled up on the beach
            Snug in the sand.

We would be bound, as those who sailed with the gods,
            In the winged friendship of youth,
And would take our seats in the stone thrones that Time 
            And custom had made smooth

And meet that man who still in the third generation
            Reigned serene, a sage
Whose tales of travels and holy decrees had ripened
            In his mind with age—

At dawn, we'd attend the sacrifice to the gods,
            The ritual slaughters
Of the three-year-old heifers, and hear the single cry
            That rose from his three daughters

When the axe thwacked, and the black-fringed, slow-rolling eye
            Drowned in a swoon
Of darkness, and the gilt horns were rendered idle,
            A hazy half moon.

My love imagined you, as a sister her brother,
            In your virginal bath,
How Polycaste rinsed your naked body and dressed you
            In a robe of fine cloth.

I thought to prod you a little with my foot 
            As dawn was about to break:
The gleaming chariot's yoked for us and ready.
            No time to lose! Awake!

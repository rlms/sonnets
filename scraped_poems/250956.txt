Claude says he, too, was given the tracks and not 
the train, the way — and not the way out, not the beyond 
beyond that bend, or the next. The place 

they call Drybridge — for the waterless bed 
of rails — where on the banks, you grow up learning 
more news from hoboes than from the mailman.

But you know nothing of the train as it passes 
behind the backs of grander houses, gutted 

warehouses, chained dogs, as it grazes an alien 
grid of fences — of stone, metal, and chain-link. 
Or that when it passes beneath the underside 

of a bridge, a boy your own age waves the way 
you do, and that there is a horse doesn't lift its head, 
and one that does, only to lower it again.

You are a grown man when the train comes 
to a scalding stop, and a lantern swings down 
the road. A man has been killed, they call out 

from behind the light's aura, and would you come see 
what you can tell of him by what's left. You do 
know his hat, and that burn scar on the back 

of his hand. What you know of his wife
you do not say and will not even the next 

night when you sit up with the body in the house 
he wanted that much shut of, her voice rigid 
as its walls while the train you hear out there in the darkness 

passes by the way it always does, as though 
the same, the very same, and, again, on 
the time it will this night be able to keep.

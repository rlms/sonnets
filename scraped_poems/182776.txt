Filene's department store 
near nineteen-fifty-three: 
An Aunt Jemima floor 
Display. Red bandanna, 

apron holding white rolls 
of black fat fast against 
the bubbling pancakes, bowls 
and bowls of pale batter. 

This is what Donna sees 
across the “Cookwares” floor, 
and hears “Donessa?” Please, 
this can not be my aunt

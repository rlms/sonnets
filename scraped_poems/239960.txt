After Hasior

They fired a bullet into the head 
of each question, trying to kill Kant's 
unending argument with Hegel. 
They burned laws, moral codes, 
& the Golden Means. Anyone 
serving tea & cookies to Death, 
looking or acting as if he knew love, 
stood before the firing squad. 
All questions had to go. Pronoun 
or noun. If it crawled on busted kneecaps, 
whimpering & begging for mercy, 
it was still half of a question.

The little skyscraper of glass boxes 
sunlight strikes the same time of day 
at a certain angle outside Zakopane 
looks like condos where nimble ghosts 
still stand up to the darkest answers. 
No, I can't hear one voice pleading. 
But I do hear gusts coming down 
from the hills. No, you're wrong again. 
The crow perched on the totem is real. 
Look at how the light lifts off its wings, 
but I wish I could understand what it is 
he's trying to say. I think I heard a name.

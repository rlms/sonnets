November wind. The feeling of knowing
 something before you said it, all over everything.
 As in, shadow take me into the side of the mountain.
 As in, open up the earth and get inside.
 Leaving doesn't mean much. Arriving
 means everything, how you came to be where you were,
 even if later it will hurt to think of it.
 And the forgotten, aren't they always
 the most remembered elsewhere, before they perish,
when someone has their eye on them,

Driving to the new dentist's office 
the slow drive of a new place 
with the McDonalds that I don't go to 
on the left, the mall two miles away. 
The Courthouse and the Old Courthouse 
road signs that break apart, the fork in the road 
that looks nothing like a fork or a spoon, in fact 
at best, maybe a knife bent in a dishwasher
that leans to one side. And I know the dentist 
will ask about my last visit and want to know 
in months that I can't say some time ago 
and I know he will ask me about flossing 
and saying when I'm in the mood won't be 
the appropriate answer.
He will call out my cavities 
as if they were names in a class. 
I brush my teeth before going in. 
It's like cleaning before the cleaning person 
but I don't want him to know I keep an untidy 
mouth. That I am the type of person who shoves 
things in the closet before guests arrive.

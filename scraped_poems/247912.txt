My father lived in a dirty-dish mausoleum,

 watching a portable black-and-white television, 

reading the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 

which he preferred to Modern Fiction. 

One by one, his schnauzers died of liver disease, 

except the one that guarded his corpse 

found holding a tumbler of Bushmills. 

"Dead is dead," he would say, an antipreacher. 

I took a plaid shirt from the bedroom closet 

and some motor oil—my inheritance. 

Once I saw him weep in a courtroom— 

neglected, needing nursing—this man who never showed 

me much affection but gave me a knack 

for solitude, which has been mostly useful.

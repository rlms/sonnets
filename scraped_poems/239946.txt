Despite the geologists' knowledge and craft, 
mocking magnets, graphs, and maps— 
in a split second the dream 
piles before us mountains as stony 
as real life. 

And since mountains, then valleys, plains 
with perfect infrastructures. 
Without engineers, contractors, workers, 
bulldozers, diggers, or supplies— 
raging highways, instant bridges, 
thickly populated pop-up cities. 

Without directors, megaphones, and cameramen— 
crowds knowing exactly when to frighten us 
and when to vanish. 

Without architects deft in their craft, 
without carpenters, bricklayers, concrete pourers—
on the path a sudden house just like a toy, 
and in it vast halls that echo with our steps 
and walls constructed out of solid air. 

Not just the scale, it's also the precision—
a specific watch, an entire fly, 
on the table a cloth with cross-stitched flowers, 
a bitten apple with teeth marks. 

And we—unlike circus acrobats, 
conjurers, wizards, and hypnotists— 
can fly unfledged, 
we light dark tunnels with our eyes, 
we wax eloquent in unknown tongues, 
talking not with just anyone, but with the dead. 

And as a bonus, despite our own freedom, 
the choices of our heart, our tastes, 
we're swept away 
by amorous yearnings for—
and the alarm clock rings. 

So what can they tell us, the writers of dream books,
the scholars of oneiric signs and omens, 
the doctors with couches for analyses— 
if anything fits, 
it's accidental, 
and for one reason only, 
that in our dreamings, 
in their shadowings and gleamings, 
in their multiplings, inconceivablings, 
in their haphazardings and widescatterings 
at times even a clear-cut meaning 
may slip through.

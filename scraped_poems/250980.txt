Sir, please accept my resignation
As of next month,
And, if it seems right, plan on replacing me.
I'm leaving much unfinished work,
Whether out of laziness or actual problems.
I was supposed to tell someone something,
But I no longer know what and to whom: I've forgotten.
I was also supposed to donate something — 
A wise word, a gift, a kiss;
I put it off from one day to the next. I'm sorry.
I'll do it in the short time that remains.
I'm afraid I've neglected important clients.
I was meant to visit
Distant cities, islands, desert lands;
You'll have to cut them from the program
Or entrust them to my successor.
I was supposed to plant trees and I didn't;
To build myself a house,
Maybe not beautiful, but based on plans.
Mainly, I had in mind
A marvelous book, kind sir,
Which would have revealed many secrets,
Alleviated pains and fears,
Eased doubts, given many
The gift of tears and laughter.
You'll find its outline in my drawer,
Down below, with the unfinished business;
I didn't have the time to write it out, which is a shame,
It would have been a fundamental work.

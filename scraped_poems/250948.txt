When Claude says blessed is he who has seen 
and believes, you know he is about to tell the one 
about bees. His father told him which kind 

of sting was worst, but you have to see some things 
for yourself, and when you ask how on earth 
do you catch a bee to see anything, he tells how 

you hunker down next to a sweet potato blossom 
and watch until one lands on the ruffled cuff 

and then ambles down into the sweeter sleeve. 
You lean over and pinch the blossom shut, 
and there you have it, ready to sting yourself 

so you can decide on your own, and he wants 
for you not to doubt this: even more blessed, 
you will be, you have heard — and not seen.

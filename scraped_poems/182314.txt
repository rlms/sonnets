The Christmas twigs crispencrispen To make crisp and needles rattle 
Along the window-ledge. 
             A solitary pearl 
Shed from the necklace spilled at last week's party 
Lies in the suety,suety Fatty; from suet, an animal fat used in cooking to create tallow snow-luminous plainness 
Of morning, on the window-ledge beside them.   
And all the furniture that circled stately 
And hospitable when these rooms were brimmed 
With perfumes, furs, and black-and-silver 
Crisscross of seasonal conversation, lapses 
Into its previous largeness. 
             I remember   
Anne's rose-sweet gravity, and the stiff grave 
Where cold so little can contain; 
I mark the queer delightful skull and crossbones 
Starlings and sparrows left, taking the crust, 
And the long loop of winter wind 
Smoothing its arc from dark ArcturusArcturus The brightest star in the northern sky, located in the constellation Boötes  down 
To the bricked corner of the drifted courtyard, 
And the still window-ledge. 
             Gentle and just pleasure 
It is, being human, to have won from space 
This unchill,unchill Warmed, thawed  habitable interior 
Which mirrors quietly the light 
Of the snow, and the new year.

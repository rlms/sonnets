He stood on his stoop
and clapped her sneakers together 
hard, a sharp report,
smacking right sole against left, 
trying to shock the mud
from each complicated tread, 
spanking those expensive footprints 
until clay flakes and plugs
ticked onto the boxwood's leaves 
like a light filthy sleet
from the rubber craters and crannies 
where they stuck weeks ago,
until her shoes were banged clean
 though that didn't stop
his stiff-armed slow-motion applause 
with her feet's emptied gloves, 
slapping mate against mate
without missing a beat,
half-wishing that hollow sound 
echoing off their neighbors' houses 
could call her back.

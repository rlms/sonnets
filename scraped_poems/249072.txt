Under the soft translucent linen,
  the ridges around your nipples
 
harden at the thought of my tongue.
  You — lying inverted like the letter ‘c' —
 
arch yourself deliberately
  wanting the warm press of my lips,
 
it's wet to coat the skin
  that is bristling, burning,
 
breaking into sweats of desire —
  sweet juices of imagination.
 
But in fact, I haven't even touched
 you. At least, not yet.

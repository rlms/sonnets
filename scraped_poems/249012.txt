The night approaches. Dusk drafts on buildings
their future ruins. Dusk deepens windows
and apertures. It hollows stones
with shadows like with water. It foretells
the near death of a hundred clouds 
to the shining host. A thin layer of dust,
the seer leaves his footprints on the roofs
as he walks home from the future 
not his own, swallowing his voice —
in its rays, fat blood flows down 
the golden armor. Wet
blue entrails. Large heads
have rolled down the shoulders. 
Speech has grown silent in deep mouths. 
 .................................................

The signs of a life without past will emerge 
like lies through the lines of an old page,
emptiness will turn into loss,
foreign sand into Ithaca.

Ithaca is the time 
when there's nowhere to go. If it's night, 
it means the night is the end of the voyage. 
A sackcloth hiding the shoulders 
of the stranger is truer than
speeches about past and future
he won't make. Nobody
will. On the streets rain readies 
hollows for the funeral, already 
overgrown with grass. 

In a long puddle he sees:
a pauper, a random victim of the skies
hangs with his head down. 
In height, he is a cloud, the size
of a lost faith
in returning home. 
 .......................

So should I, a pauper sitting 
by a stranger's door, declare: I'm Odysseus,
and I'm back. Should I say: 
I'm recognized. After the mourning songs
tears are still rolling down my face. I have been
summoned to clothe the past
in the shining ice.

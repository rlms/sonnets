While my husband packed to fly back to Vietnam,
 this time as a tourist instead of a soldier,

I drove to the zoo to say goodbye to the musk oxen 
who were being shipped out early next morning

to Tacoma. We were getting lions instead. 
When I got there, it was too easy to park.

The zoo was closing early so they wouldn't let me in. 
I went back to my car and slid into the driver's seat.

Sobs tore from deep in my chest, I who had never 
seen a musk ox and never cared until now.

Learning to love differently is hard,
love with the hands wide open, love
with the doors banging on their hinges,
the cupboard unlocked, the wind
 roaring and whimpering in the rooms
 rustling the sheets and snapping the blinds
 that thwack like rubber bands
 in an open palm.

It hurts to love wide open
 stretching the muscles that feel
 as if they are made of wet plaster,
 then of blunt knives, then
 of sharp knives.

It hurts to thwart the reflexes
 of grab, of clutch ; to love and let
 go again and again. It pesters to remember
 the lover who is not in the bed,
 to hold back what is owed to the work
 that gutters like a candle in a cave
 without air, to love consciously,
 conscientiously, concretely, constructively.

I can't do it, you say it's killing
 me, but you thrive, you glow
 on the street like a neon raspberry,
 You float and sail, a helium balloon
 bright bachelor's button blue and bobbing
 on the cold and hot winds of our breath,
 as we make and unmake in passionate
 diastole and systole the rhythm
 of our unbound bonding, to have
 and not to hold, to love
 with minimized malice, hunger
 and anger moment by moment balanced.

It chafed like some new skin we'd grown, 
or feathers, the cummerbund and starched collar 
pinching us to show how real this transformation 
into princes was, how powerful we'd grown 
by getting drivers' licenses, how tall and total 
our new perspective, above that rusty keyhole 
parents squinted through. We'd found the key: 
that nothing really counts except a romance 
bright as Technicolor, wide as Cinerama, 
and this could be the night. No lie.

The chickens 
are circling and 
blotting out the   
day. The sun is   
bright, but the   
chickens are in   
the way. Yes, 
the sky is dark 
with chickens,   
dense with them. 
They turn and   
then they turn   
again. These   
are the chickens 
you let loose 
one at a time 
and small— 
various breeds. 
Now they have   
come home 
to roost—all 
the same kind 
at the same speed.

Please think of this as not merely a piece
Of writing that anyone would fully
 Appreciate, but as plain and simple
 Words that attempt to arouse whatever
 Appetencies you, especially, depend
 Upon language to fulfill; that drench you 
 In several levels of meaning at once,
 Rendering my presence superfluous.
 In other words, welcome this as a poem,
 Not merely a missive I've slowly composed
 And tucked under your windshield wiper
 So that these onlookers who saw me bash
 In your fender will think I'm jotting down
 The usual information and go away.

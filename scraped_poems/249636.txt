One can't help admiring 
their rickety grace

 and old-world feathers 
like seasoned boardwalk planks. 

They pass in silent pairs,
 as if a long time ago 

they had wearied of calling out. 
The wind tips them, their

 ungainly, light-brown weight, 
into a prehistoric wobble, 

wings'-end fingers stretching
 from fingerless gloves, 

necks slightly tucked and stiff, 
peering forward and down, 

like old couples arm in arm 
on icy sidewalks, careful, 

careful, mildly surprised 
by how difficult it has become 

to stay dignified and keep moving 
even after the yelping gulls have gone; 

even after the scattered sand, 
and the quietly lodged complaints.

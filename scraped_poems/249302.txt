Summer-long the gulls' old umbra cry 
unraveled ease
but certain waves went by, then by. 
The sky shook out the days.

The seabirds' hunger rose in rings, 
flung rock-clams to their shatterings, 
raked gullets full, the bone-bills scraped.

High noon: oceans of time escaped.

                             *

All winter we slept benched together, 
breakers, sleepdrunk children in a car 
not conscious where they go.

We kneaded bread, kept out the weather, 
while old suspicions huddled by the door, 
mice in the snow.

                             *

In spring, the leaving bloomed— 
oak leaf unfurled, a foot, resplendent
vigorous, aching to shake loose
but still dependent.

One morning moongreen loaves 
rose into bones that rose to lift 
our skin like sleeves, 
our time together's revenant.

                             *

Perennial fall, come cool the cliffs, 
bring quiet, sulfur, early dark. 
Represent as you must: dusk, dying, ends 
and row us into winter's water:

The body, wind-whipped, forms stiff peaks,
ice settles in the marrow bone.
At the chest, the live stone breaks against the beak,
beak breaks against stone.

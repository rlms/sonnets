For Flaco

                                     A cooler 
head of lettuce prevailed, but when the actor 
asked his question and paused 
for us to watch him pause and think 
inside the pause, I almost answered
as if we were in a bar, just the two of us 
and a balcony and spotlight. The two of us
and programs and makeup and a sofa 
from the director's living room and the black/
womb/agora/séance of theater inviting us to feel 
together alone. I recall I don't recall 
the question but its scope on his face 
was immense, as if he were the Milky Way 
asking am I pretty, am I here for sure for real 
for long

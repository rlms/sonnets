praise the Hennessy, the brown 
shine, the dull burn. praise 
the dare, the take it, the no face 
you're supposed to make.
praise the house, its many rooms,
hardwood and butter leather couches;
its richness. praise the rich, their friendship.
praise the friends: the child of the well off,
the child of the well off, the child of  well,
the child of welfare, the child of welfare.
praise the diversity but praise the Hennessy,
and again,           and again.           praise 
the new year upon us. praise my stumble,
the shaky eye, the fluid arm, but the steady 
hand. praise my hand, the burning it has.
praise the dive into the gut of a friend; the dousing 
of my hand in his ribs. praise the softness of skin, 
the way it always gives.

praise the pulling, the calming down.

praise the fuck that, the jump back into all 
five of my friends fist first. praise all 
five of my friends pinning me into the thick 
carpet, knees in my back. praise my back,
how it hurts and raises anyway, how it flips, 
how it's the best friend of my fists.
praise the swinging pool cue, how it whips 
air like a disobedient child, praise the disobedient 
and all the chilling           i won't do.
praise the child smile on my face, the fun 
plunging a knee into a cheek of my best friend.
praise his blood, the brightness of it, a sun i bask in.
praise my blood, the nose flowing wild with effort, 
the mess and taste of it, praise the swallowing,
salt and its sweetness.

praise the morning, the impossible blue, 
Midwestern  January above us. praise 
the blues dulled in my denim by all 
the brown. praise the brown shine, the dull 
burn.

praise all six in my jeans, our salt 
and life sitting dry on my thighs
mixing, refusing to wash away.

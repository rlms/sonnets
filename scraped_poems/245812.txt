As the storm-struck oak leaned closer to the house —
The remaining six-story half of the tree listing toward the glass box 
Of  the kitchen like someone in the first tilt of stumbling —
The other half crashed into the neighbors' yards, a massive
Diagonal for which we had no visual cue save for 
An antler dropped by a constellation —
As the ragged half   leaned nearer, the second storm of cloying snow 
Began pulling on the shocked, still-looming splitting, and its branches dragged 
Lower like ripped hems it was tripping over
Until they rustled on the roof under which I
Quickly made dinner, each noise a threat from a body under which we so recently 
Said, Thank goodness for our tree, how it has accompanied us all these years,
Thank goodness for its recitation of the seasons out our windows and over
The little lot of our yard, thank goodness for the birdsong and  squirrel games 
Which keep us from living alone, and for its proffered shade, the crack of the bat
Resounding through September when its dime-sized acorns 
Land on the tin awning next door. Have
Mercy on us, you, the massively beautiful, now ravaged and charged
With destruction.
We did speak like that. As if from a book of psalms
Because it took up the sky

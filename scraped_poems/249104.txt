When my grandmother died
I thought, “She can't die again.”
Everything in her life 
happened once and forever:
her bed on our roof,
the battle of good and evil in her tales, 
her black clothes,
her mourning for her daughter who
“was killed by headaches,”
the rosary beads and her murmur, 
“Forgive us our sins,”
her empty vase from the Ottoman time,
her braid, each hair a history —

First were the Sumerians,
their dreams inscribed in clay tablets.
They drew palms, so dates ripen before their sorrows.
They drew an eye to chase evil 
away from their city.
They drew circles and prayed for them:
a drop of water
a sun
a moon
a wheel spinning faster than Earth.
They begged: “Oh gods, don't die and leave us alone.”

Over the Tower of Babel, 
light is exile,
blurred,
its codes crumbs of songs 
leftover for the birds.

More naked emperors
passed by the Tigris
and more ships . . . 
The river full
of crowns
helmets
books
dead fish,
and on the Euphrates, corpse-lilies floating.

Every minute a new hole in the body of the ship.

The clouds descended on us 
war by war,
picked up our years,
our hanging gardens,
and flew away like storks.

We said there isn't any worse to come.

Then the barbarians came
to the mother of two springs.
They broke my grandmother's grave: my clay tablet.
They smashed the winged bulls whose eyes
were sunflowers
widely open
watching the fragments of our first dreams
for a lifetime.

My hand on the map
as if on an old scar.

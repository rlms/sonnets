I'm a tranquilizer. 
I'm effective at home. 
I work in the office. 
I can take exams 
on the witness stand. 
I mend broken cups with care. 
All you have to do is take me, 
let me melt beneath your tongue, 
just gulp me 
with a glass of water. 

I know how to handle misfortune, 
how to take bad news. 
I can minimize injustice, 
lighten up God's absence, 
or pick the widow's veil that suits your face. 
What are you waiting forâ€” 
have faith in my chemical compassion. 

You're still a young man/woman. 
It's not too late to learn how to unwind. 
Who said 
you have to take it on the chin? 

Let me have your abyss. 
I'll cushion it with sleep. 
You'll thank me for giving you 
four paws to fall on. 

Sell me your soul. 
There are no other takers. 

There is no other devil anymore.

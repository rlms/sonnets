Stilled as in image, at dawn sliding into 
blue harbor, boats clang, where does he
the man I imagine gripping several ropes
return from. Is he conflicted, does he
perceive the sky oscillating like 
a dimmer machine, a mouth, a war, language
not declaring its most
effective self, bellum grazing ever
nearer to beauty, a possible apotheosis how 
what is left of sense
is comfort. Not inebriated much anymore,
I rented a lawn to stand in with you, crueler 
was always singing to our mutual forks,
knives. Our translation 
of a subject drones
on unblinking, something black for him
returning, his forearms there laid
themselves down, ships gone out another 
pale-plated night.

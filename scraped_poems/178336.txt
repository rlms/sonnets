The Visconti put you on their flag: a snake   
devouring a child, or are you throwing up a man 
feet first? Some snakes hunt frogs, some freedom of will.   
There's good in you: a man can count years on your skin.   
Generously, you mother and father a stolen boy,   
to the chosen you offer your cake of figs.   
A goiter on my neck, you lick my ear with lies,   
yet I must listen, smile and kiss your cheek   
or you may swallow the child completely. In Milan   
there is a triptych, the throned Virgin in glory,   
placed on the marble below, a dead naked man   
and a giant dead frog of human scale on its back.   
There's hope! My eyes look into the top of my head   
at the wreath of snakes that sometimes crowns me.

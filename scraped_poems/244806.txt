Four weeks in, quarreling and far 
from home, we came to the loneliest place. 
A western railroad town. Remember? 
I left you at the campsite with greasy pans 
and told our children not to follow me. 
The dying light had made me desperate. 
I broke into a hobbled run, across tracks, 
past warehouses with sun-blanked windows 
to where a playground shone in a wooded clearing. 
Then I was swinging, out over treetops. 
I saw myself never going back, yet 
whatever breathed in the mute woods 
was not another life. The sun sank. 
I let the swing die, my toes scuffed earth, 
and I was rocked into remembrance 
of the girl who had dreamed the life I had. 
Through night, dark at the root, I returned to it.

The kitchen in the house had a nook for eating, a groove
for the broom behind the door and the woman moved through
it like bathing, reaching ladles from drawers, turning to lift

the milk from the refrigerator while still stirring the pudding, 
as if the room and everything in it were as intimate to her as her
body, as beautiful and worthy of her attention as the elbows

which each day she soothed with rose lotion or the white legs 
she lifted, again and again, in turn, while watching television. 
To be in that room must be what it was like to be the man

next to her at night, or the child who, at six o'clock had stood 
close enough to smell the wool of her sweater through the steam, 
and later, at the goodnight kiss, could breathe the flavor of her hair—

codfish and broccoli—and taste the coffee, which was darkness 
on her lips, and listen then from upstairs to the water running 
down, the mattress drifting down the river, a pale moonmark

on the floor, and hear the clink of silverware—the stars, their distant 
speaking—and picture the ceiling—the back of a woman kneeling, 
covering the heart and holding up the bed and roof and cooling sky.

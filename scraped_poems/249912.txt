Sorrento, at night the long fingers of your orange lights 
Prick me in the sizzling streets, where the pinnacles 
Of other people ring tinny and papier-mâché. Is this the way 
Up to the murderous cliff? It's most important that I get there 
And leave no witness. Ah, is this the majolica medallion 
Which marks the grave of girl abducted by a stallion 
Whom she gave a lump of maple sugar?
                                                                               For that was in an autumn, 
The time of year when young girls get hopeless and feel like 
Giving it all away, the way a matronly merchant
 Might brush off her lap, at the iron end of the market day: 
It's over, it's worthless, without deserving and without 
Purpose have I nourished this hope in my small patch of earth, 
A sickly weed whose nodding sun's gone nova.

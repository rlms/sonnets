â€”Bahram (Pakistani 14-year-old held in an Afghan prison) 
Like the pied piper
 the mullah drives his battered truck
 through dusty villages, his loudspeaker
 singing: Join the battle against the infidels.
 Fight for Jihad and live eternally with Allah.
 Lift up your guns for Him and you shall never die.

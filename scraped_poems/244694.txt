From flowering gnarled trees 
they come, weighing down
the branches, dropping 
with a soft sound onto 
the loamy ground. Falling 
and fallen. That's a pome.

Common as an apple. Or 
more rare. A quince or pear.
A knife paring away soft skin
exposes tart sweet flesh.
And deeper in, five seeds in a core
are there to make more pomes.

Look how it fits in my hand.
What to do? What to do?
I could give it to you.
Or leave it on the table
with a note both true and untrue:
Ceci n'est pas un po√®me.

I could paint it as a still life,
a small window of light 
in the top right corner
(only a dab of the whitest white),
a place to peer in and watch it
change and darken as pomes will do.

O I remember days....
Climbing the branches of a tree
ripe and heavy with pomes. 
Taking whatever I wanted.
There were always enough then.
Always enough.

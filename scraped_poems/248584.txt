If  you give money to an animal
He or she gets cloying and aggressive
But when arrested for that behavior
Says, “I didn't know anything, my reps
Did it. Well they did. These humans
Committed their tiny crimes in the mail,” it says,
“Knowing animals are photogenic. You can hold
One in your lap or hold a sheaf of  photos
In which a feline looks like you yourself  tearing off a leg
Of a springbok antelope, which prey looks like you
Concentrating on the flee instinct,” it says.
I tend to agree with it. It and
All of them have expressions on their faces, four limbs,
Two eyes, noses, ears, etcetera, how close can you get to you
Or me, and then there's the same insides. If  it is a cheetah
Do not put it in your lap. If  it's
A black rhino it weighs 2,250 lbs.
And has two! sharp horns about 24 in. ea.!
Let's suppose nothing about that one and not say
It has a facial expression. My own opinion
Is it will have one in a matter of time.
There are ten other scenes in which I look like the animals
In them so don't argue I'm writing yet another check this week
And as a matter of fact I'd like to smack something,
Bite it, and cook it. You do that, tonight
For instance. If one of us eats the other
It's a very big crime
Not tiny like the revolutionary revelation in a solicitation
That we are like the animals, no, are them,
Which is bigger in evolution and spirituality,
Sure, and in the final accounting
Much more important, but today
Don't put a cheetah in your lap and don't eat other humans.

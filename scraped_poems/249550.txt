Some dreams are like glass
 or a light beneath the surface of the water. 

A girl weeps in a garden.
 A woman turns her head and that is all. 

We wake up a hundred times and 
don't know where we are. Asleep 

at the wheel. Saved by 
the luck of angels. 

Everyone touching his lips 
to something larger, the watermark 

of some great sorrow. Everyone 
giving himself away. The way 

the rose gives up the stem and 
floats completely, without history.

 In the end every road leads 
to water. What is left of a garden 

is the dream, an alphabet of longing. 
The shadow of the girl. Perfume.

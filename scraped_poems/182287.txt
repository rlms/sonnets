In April we will pierce his body. 
It is March. Snow is dust over the branches. 
A pony hunches in the orchard. 
I stand at the frozen mouth of the river, 
Thinking of you. 
In the house where you live 
Frost glitters on the windows 
Like uncounted pieces of silver. 
Already they are preparing the wine and the bread.

The field is banked with purple asters 
And a spill of mustard flowers. 
The earth has taken on terrible proportions. 
Out in an unused meadow 
The wildflowers have already covered 
The delicate bones of an Indian. 
Bees are flying across the meadow 
To a hive under the rafters of the barn. 
Someone is leading a horse with crippled bones 
Into the spikes of clover.

Alexander died this morning, 
Leaving his worldly possessions 
To the strongest. 
I watched an empire fade across his lips. 
They propped him in the sun a while, 
And then three women came to scour his body 
Like a continent. 
I am afraid of what the world will do. 
Only this afternoon 
I heard two worms conversing 
In the shadow of his breastbone. 
I slipped out of the palace 
And entered a vein of gillyflowers 
On the edge of potter's field. 
I will not be missed. 
No one even noticed.

I have been thinking of the son 
I would like to have. 
The leaves have all gone yellow 
Overnight, wrinkling like hands 
In the updraught. 
I drove my car by the creek 
Because I had nowhere else to go. 
The milkweed's delicate closet had been fractured, 
Filling the air with rumors. 
Despite all I could do, the sumac 
Had taken on the color of a mouth. 
Tonight, I perceive the young girls 
In my mother's blood 
Letting their seed pass by unnoticed, 
A red nativity.

Last night they dragged the canal 
For an old man's body. 
Now he is singing for a hook 
Just below water level. 
A branch of ice is splitting open 
Across each window, 
And snow is dismantling the weeds 
Like the breakable furniture of a boudoir. 
I have been rereading your letters. 
It is too cold for a virgin birth to occur 
Even in the frosty suburbs 
Of a wildflower. 


    VI 

I have learned to camouflage myself in church, 
Masking my body 
With the body of a saint. 
Last night frost glazed the face of Mary Magdalene, 
And snow rode up to the altar windows. 
Before morning, the sparrows came down 
To the body of Saint Francis. 
Now he is upholstered in oak leaves 
Like a living room chair. 
This morning we are preparing a crucifixion. 
I am thinking of you now. 
With the velvet at my knees 
And the silverware shining on the altar 
And the stained glass moving out of focus 
And the cross veiled in black, 
I am present for the news of an enormous death. 
I take the bread on my tongue 
Like one of Christ's fingers, 
And the wine rides through my breast 
Like a dark hearse. 
All the while I am thinking of you. 
An avalanche of white carnations 
Is drifting across your voice 
As it drifts across the voices of confession. 
But the snow keeps whispering of you over and over.

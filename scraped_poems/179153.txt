At the throat of Soweto 
a devil language falls 
slashing 
claw syllables to shred and leave   
raw 
the tongue of the young 
girl 
learning to sing 
her own name 

Where she would say   
                              water 
They would teach her to cry 
                                        blood 
Where she would save 
                              grass 
They would teach her to crave 
                                           crawling into the 
                                                    grave

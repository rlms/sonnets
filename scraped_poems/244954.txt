A spring day oozes through Trastevere. 
A nun in turquoise sneakers contemplates the stairs. 
Ragazzi everywhere, the pus in their pimples 
pushing up like paperwhites in the midday sun. 

Every hard bulb stirs. 

The fossilized egg in my chest 
cracks open against my will. 

I was so proud not to feel my heart.
Waking means being angry.

The dead man on the Congo road 
was missing an ear, 
which had either been eaten 
or someone was wearing it 
around his neck. 

The dead man looked like this. No, that. 

Here's a flock of tourists
in matching canvas hats. 
This year will take from me
the hardened person 
who I longed to be. 
I am healing by mistake. 
Rome is also built on ruins.

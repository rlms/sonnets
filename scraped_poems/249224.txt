He worked years on the tablet, 
deciphering the pictographs. He knew 
it was a kind of language, those images. 
An eye. A bird, maybe a crow. 
A basket of wheat. A ladder. 
Did the order of the images matter? 
He cross-referenced similar texts. 
He studied the history of the region 
and satisfied many hours in the tablet's service. 
In a cousin language, a ladder 
was the word for happiness, to rise up, 
to be lifted above the ordinary. 
After years of work, he sorted it out. 
It was poetry, bad poetry, adolescent: 
"Today, I am happy, 
happy all this day, today."

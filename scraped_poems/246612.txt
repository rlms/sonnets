It may be as close as an old man in Michigan 
comes to the sound of the sea. Call it thunder 
if you want, but it's not thunder, not at all. 
It's more like the rush of semis on a freeway

somewhere between Bay City and Flint, 
the road a son will take when he learns, 
sometime around the last taste of a strap, 
that the life he was born to is nothing

at all like a life he'd ever bother to live. 
There's an anger in it, a tin-edged constancy 
that has no rhythm, quite, something more 
like white noise that still won't let you sleep.

Think of some man, needing to get a crop in, 
but the fields are sop, so he's trying to find 
something to fix, something to keep his hands 
working, something to weld, something to pound,

something to wrap his calloused palms around 
that might do less damage than a lead-rope 
knotted and tossed over the limb of a tree. 
If you ever decide to lose your years

by working this land, you might think again, 
about the barn you build, or roofing it with tin.

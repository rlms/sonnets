What do you mean by rashes of ash? Is industry 
systematic work, assiduous activity, or ownership 
of factories? Is ripple agitate lightly? Are 
we tossed in tune when we write poems? And 
what or who emboss with gloss insignias of air? 

Is the Fabric about which you write in the epigraph 
of your poem an edifice, a symbol of heaven? 

Does freight refer to cargo of lading carried 
for pay by water, land or air? Or does it mean 
payment for such transportation? Or a freight 
train? When you say a commoded journey, 
do you mean a comfortable journey or a good train 
with well-equipped commodoties? But, then, why 
do you drop the ‘a' before slumberous friend? And 
when you write, in “Why I Am Not a Christian” 
You always throw it down / But you never 
pick it up

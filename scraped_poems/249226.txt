There is
 no
 audience
 because
 there is
 no audience.

 So if you speak only to
 imagined beings
 what does "only" mean?

 --------------------------

 This building formerly a restaurant . . .
 this small room has been scraped of its paint 
 and denuded of most former furniture: but 
 also it has grown in size—can a building be 
 enticed to grow? Because it is now as big as an 
 airplane hangar.

 --------------------------

 Your
           beautiful face 
 unbloodied beneath
           flies

 Mother of flies your
           beauty 
 to turn to. If only 
 the audience
 could see how
 you are peaceful and the
           flies 
 languid, glossy

 But the audience will still bring
           its own feelings 
 to these 
 words

 not seeing you
                not seeing 
 what I 
 am present for.

 --------------------------

 Who has left me 
 here, I have.

 Who are your 
 familiars

                    Come 
             into the 
 enlarging 
 page if you dare

 --------------------------

      Because he invented 
 your shape I do mean 
 structure

 because he invented you badly 

            everything is still hidden.

 --------------------------

 I was to impale myself on a
 quadrangular
 steel rod, with a blunt end
                      with a blunt end 
 which would make puncture
       more difficult 
 and I tried—it's too hard. I can't 
 Okay said the voice. I can't 
 Okay

 then I was weeping
                               But it's blood! I'm 
 crying blood! I 
 screamed

 That's part of it
 said the voice.

 ---------------------------

 I think this is hard.
 (That's part of it)

 How they prefer him must go.

 I think this is difficult singing

 Length and repetition 
          create power

 If this voice can return like 
          a body

 It resembles something that's already been, 

 Changing.

 ------------------------------

 Chestnuts broken
 autumnal fungi
 so you will remember, that
           it's fall 
 outside
          falling. you'll go down

 this is no story for the puling
           social classes 
 No not at all 
 it's for us my familiars say 
 who let me weep blood on their ground.

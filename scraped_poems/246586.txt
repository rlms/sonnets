I go to the corner liquor store 
for a bottle of water, middle 
of a hectic day, must get out 
of the office, stop making decisions, 
quit obsessing does my blue skirt clash 
with my hot pink flats; should I get 
my mother a caregiver or just put her 
in a home, and I pull open the glass 
refrigerator door, am confronted
by brands—Arrowhead, Glitter Geyser, 
Deer Park, spring, summer, winter water, 
and clearly the bosses of bottled water: 
Real Water and Smart Water—how different 
will they taste? If I drink Smart Water
will I raise my IQ but be less authentic? 
If I choose Real Water will I no longer 
deny the truth, but will I attract confused, 
needy people who'll take advantage
of my realness by dumping their problems 
on me, and will I be too stupid to help them 
sort through their murky dilemmas? 
I take no chances, buy them both,
sparkling smart, purified real, drain both bottles, 
look around to see is anyone watching? 
I'm now brilliantly hydrated.
Both real and smart my insides bubble
with compassion and intelligence
as I walk the streets with a new swagger,
knowing the world is mine.

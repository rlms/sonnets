I'm jotting down these lines,
having borrowed a pen from a waitress
in this roadside restaurant. Three rusty pines
prop up the sky in the windows.
My soup gets cold, which implies

I'll eat it cold. Soon I too
will leave a tip on the table, merge
into the beehive of travelers
and board one of the ferries,
where there's always a line to the loo
and no one knows where the captain is.

Slightly seasick, I keep on writing
of the wind-rose and lobster traps,
seagulls, if anyâ€”and there always are.
Check the air and you'll see them
above straw hats and caps.
The sun at noon glides like a monstrous star-

fish through clouds. Others drink iced tea, 
training binoculars on a tugboat.
 When I finish this letter, I'll take a gulp 
from the flask you gave me for the road 
in days when I was too young to care about 
those on the pier who waved goodbye.

I miss them now: cousins in linen dresses,
 my mother, you, boys in light summer shirts. 
Life is too long. The compass needle dances.
 Everything passes by. The ferry passes
 by ragged yellow shores.

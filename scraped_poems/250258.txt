The flexible arc 
described by treetop leaves 
when breathing currents ripple 
a branch to one, 
then the other side. 
Or the level, quickened swell 
that follows a gust over wetlands 
home to a million reeds.

Any terrain you find arises from all 
that came before: succeeding 
event horizons from earlier eras 
brought forward by today's considered 
impetus to lift the way it looks, 
lightly, freely
out toward whatever senses you are thereâ€”
 breathed into completion, a sphere,
 into all it is.

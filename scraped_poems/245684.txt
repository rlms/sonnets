The church knelt heavy
above us as we attended Sunday School, 
circled by age group and hunkered
on little wood folding chairs
where we gave our nickels, said
our verses, heard the stories, sang
the solid, swinging songs.

It could have been God above
in the pews, His restless love sifting
with dust from the joists. We little
seeds swelled in the stone cellar, bursting 
to grow toward the light.

Maybe it was that I liked how, upstairs, outside, 
an avid sun stormed down, burning the sharp- 
edged shadows back to their buildings, or
how the winter air knifed
after the dreamy basement.

Maybe the day we learned whatever 
would have kept me believing
I was just watching light
poke from the high, small window
and tilt to the floor where I could make it 
a gold strap on my shoe, wrap
my ankle, embrace 
any part of me.

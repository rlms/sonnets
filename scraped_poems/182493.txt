Green first thing each day sees waves— 
the chair, armoire, overhead fixtures, you name it, 
waves—which, you might say, things really are, 
but Green just lies there awhile breathing 
long slow breaths, in and out, through his mouth 
like he was maybe seasick, until in an hour or so 
the waves simmer down and then the trails and colors 
off of things, that all quiets down as well and Green 
starts to think of washing up, breakfast even 
with everything still moving around, colors, trails, 
and sounds, from the street and plumbing next door, 
vibrating—of course you might say that's what 
sound really is, after all, vibrations—but Green, 
he's not thinking physics at this stage, nuh-uh, 
our boy's only trying to get himself out of bed, 
get a grip, but sometimes, and this is the kicker, 
another party, shall we say, is in the room 
with Green, and Green knows this other party 
and they do not get along, which understates it 
quite a bit, quite a bit, and Green knows 
that this other cat is an hallucination, right, 
but these two have a routine that goes way back 
and Green starts hollering, throwing stuff 
until he's all shook up, whole day gone to hell, 
bummer . . . 

                         Anyhow, the docs are having a look, 
see if they can't dream up a cocktail, 
but seems our boy ate quite a pile of acid one time, 
clinical, wow, enough juice for half a block— 
go go go, little Greenie—blew the wiring out 
from behind his headlights and now, no matter what, 
can't find the knob to turn off the show.

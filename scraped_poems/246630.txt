It begins in a cow lane 
with bees and white clover, 
courses along corn, rushes 
accelerando against rocks. 
It rises to a teetering pitch 
as I cross a shaky tree-bridge, 
syncopates a riff 
over the dissonance 
of trashâ€”derelict icebox 
with a missing door, 
mohair loveseat sinking 
into thistle. It winds through green 
adder's mouth, faint as the bells 
of Holsteins heading home. 
Blue shadows lengthen, 
but the undertow 
of a harmony pulls me on 
through raspy Joe-pye-weed 
and staccato-barbed fence. 
It hums in a culvert 
beneath cars, then empties 
into a river that flows oboe-deep 
past Indian dance ground, waterwheel 
and town, past the bleached 
stones in the churchyard, 
the darkening hill.

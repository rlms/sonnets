Fifteen I got a job at Leggett's, stock 
boy, fifty cents an hour. Moved up—I come 
from that kind of people—to toys at Christmas,
 then Menswear and finally Shoes. 

                                                  Quit to go 
to college, never worked retail again, but 
I still really like stores, savor merchandise 
neatly stacked on tables, sweaters wanting
 my gliding palm as I walk by, mannequins 
weirdly sexy behind big glass windows, 
shoes shiny and just waiting for the right feet. 

So why in my seventies do Target, Lowes,
 and Home Depot spin me dizzy and lost, 
wanting my mother to find me, wipe my eyes,
 hold my hand all the way out to the car?

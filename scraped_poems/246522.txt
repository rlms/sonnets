My throat is full of sparklers 
                                                    making me a lighthouse
                                 for a loveship       that can fly

Our mother monarchy
                                  sweet land paternity

I'll eat their offspring's money       and let you have a bite 

In wilder colors       I can love the copy of  you 
                                  which is great            when we have breasts

He will breathe through contractions
           and she will heal the faceless
                                  and use her eyes       to steel his legs 

You must see that I'm eating for two sexes

Minimalism means       nothing making more
                                                of  what isn't there

            a green preconception
              divining a baby gender
                                    for which I qualified 
            with braids ablaze       and stuck to my back 

We are going to win       then make extra babies
            yes we make enough
                to make a country 

Text unto the winged baby       the tiny pill of  mystery
                                that makes me want to tickle the world
            until it starts barfing clouds

Make it free       is not the advice we paid for
            but a long song about the flavor of nowhere 

                                                   and how we never fill it
           and how I shave my buzzardy wings       to offend the sublime

While I'm quick to swallow       the heaviest business
                       and quicker yet to modify that trash
        you have a poultice       for sudden holes 

                       you have a knife in ten minutes
            you will marry a parent       and make it do
                                    whatever you tell it

The raptor you were       does an end-run around sorrow 
                       but I'm right here sweetness

                       out of  the glass closet                voilà
                voilà        so what do you make of my baby

Tonight we bomb 
Tonight we blitz 
Tonight we barrage 
Tonight we make the greater migration
Tonight our fabulous flock shits napalm on the criminal dads

For I am a figure       first of girls in orbit

                the best reason I have to eat your bed

I am spangled breasts       I am shaved 
                        like any birdboy       only huger
                 than babies or ladybugs 

                       one of each is precious 
                        a million a menace 

My inside is a live mine 
          and I'm after the light that sustains the skin of  women 
                     scooping the spectacle 
          where everyone freaks everyone 

They will say how do you do Mister Ms. Thunderbride
                 and I will say I do it distorted 

                             and you       will marry a million of  you 
                                                              in your twisted gown of  flames

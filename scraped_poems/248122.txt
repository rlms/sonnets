A David psalm.
    The LORD is my shepherd,
                              I shall not want.
    In grass meadows He makes me lie down,
                              by quiet waters guides me. 
    My life He brings back.
                              He leads me on pathways of justice
                                             for His name's sake.
    Though I walk in the vale of death's shadow,
                              I fear no harm,
                                             for You are with me. 
    Your rod and Your staff—
                              it is they that console me.
    You set out a table before me
                              in the face of my foes.
    You moisten my head with oil,
                              my cup overflows.
    Let but goodness and kindness pursue me
                              all the days of my life.
    And I shall dwell in the house of the LORD
                              for many long days.

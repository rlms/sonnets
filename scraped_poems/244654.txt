The ghost is a torn sheet, 
the skeleton's suit came from a rack in a store 
the witch is flameproof, but who knows 
what dark streets they have taken here? 
Brother Death, here is a candy bar. 
For the lady wearing the hat from Salem: gum. 
And a penny for each eye, Lost Soul. 
They fade away with their heavy sacks. 
Thanks! I yell just in time.
                                             Thanks for another year!

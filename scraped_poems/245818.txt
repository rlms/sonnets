Perhaps you covet something of 
               its emptiness, its uselessness 

in matters of  yearning or feeling 
               another's yearn, that it can't 

know a damn thing, yet damns 
               everything it touches: the water 

it gathers along its passage, 
               the air it pushes through,

swallow-like. It is no bird,
               though you envy the song 

you hear only after it's gone, 
               even if  it sings through paper, 

a goat, the neck of a man 
               wearing a scarf that tufts just as 

the rest of   him flies out of
               his shoes and collapses in dirt.

Or, how it is like the dirt
               receiving him, the privilege 

of not knowing if   he was 
              kind or unkind, as you

chamber another, waiting for 
              someone to come for his shoes.

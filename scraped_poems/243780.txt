Questions for a zoologist
starting with anatomy
        concluding with love:

Is a turtle's skin loaned? 
True or false: weight of his shell 
        is lighter 
        than the light of drums. 

What is the under-shell 
and is it tough as a mangrove? 

Can he see through his shell-box?
Can he see out the rear 
                        to this sea of ours? 

Does he exist in the order of things? 
How does life begin, when does it end
            and is that good or evil?

Yellow margin over a cuttlebone, 
domed carapace
        is it a lonely world

of sow bugs, cutworms, and God?

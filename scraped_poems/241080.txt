One container of spaghetti sauce
 Grandma made before she died.

 Two old pieces of wedding cake
 you couldn't pay me to eat.

 Three snowballs from last winter
 slightly deformed, no longer fluffy.

 Four small flounder from the time
 Grandpa took me deep-sea fishing.

 Everything coated with a thick
 white layer of sadness.

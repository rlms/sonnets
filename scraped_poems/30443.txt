I have become the smaller flag on a ship, 
the shorter rafters of a roof, a knave 
in a pack of cards. I wear a skimpy coat, 
tall leather boot, and leather drinking flask. 
I am captured in a child's game 
and hit when grown men gamble. 
I am what they call a tame ape.

I was a common man 
whose job was to lift weight. 
Mechanical devices that replaced 
my muscles took my job and pay 
and more—they took my human name. 
And I, who used to pull 
my master's boots, hoist meat 
and turn the spit, work the roller 
and the winch, climb the steeple, 
strike the bell and connect lines 
in telephone exchange, am a daw, 
the tiniest of crows, gathering 
loose sticks to nest in castle ruins. 

The solace of six centuries—and still—
is once, on a high and windy hill, 
beside a well that was clear and full, 
I kissed a girl named Gylle.

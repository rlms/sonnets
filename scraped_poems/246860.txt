And whenever they couldn't speak they looked at each other.
How long should I look at the world before I go home?
It's a moody life like Debussy on a weekend
and all the appointments and money and drinks they do go.
So with our beautiful coats we went back to that mess 
and what happened? Someone found what they wanted 
by night, by mistake. In the car it felt like summer 
and we lived with no sun    . . .    just metals and leather.

It doesn't get easier to watch the play with an end.
On the way out someone said, what a terrible way to portray life.
But about us. Hide all week then some place 
we go empty the dark in. In the dark 
with our vices and best shirts and history's dress. 
Then you could find me anytime. And then there's right now. 
Where wouldn't we go to be no one and those people again?

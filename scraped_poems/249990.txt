No, worry about nothing 
but the chiseling 
of hills into distance 
in the slight haze

and sleep lost over color 
no two ever the same

the wringing hands
 float ashore amazed. 
Worry about beauty. 
It can sell you anything. 
Lakes collect in the 
chambers of the heart 
where the sailboats are made
 of flying fish about 
the size of match heads.

Sleep can be lost as
easily as a house key,
the shock can consume
at any moment
if the hills are not risingÂ 
weather is wearing them down
and you are driving
north in the late afternoon
or holding your eyes
in your hands like addresses.

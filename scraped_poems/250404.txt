For Rabbi Berger, Beth El Synagogue, Durham North Carolina
Bess was my gussy friend
She always took care.
From the friction
Or could. a bell is something different.

Altogether. Such costly errors 
Of the mind. Eso and exoterror 
Skeletons. The pink body 
Eating its shell.

She had pleaded not to pick 
Up with the underneath 
Legs and all scrabbling. 
But the fluorescent tests 
Allowed for prepreception.

Every ghost limb has a war story.
But not every war story has a limb.
Fifteen thousand candles are
Little kittens. It's an exed out eye
Thing for this one.
Or in the rubble, an Oboe
Tuned by the wind.
Half of him is impounded
In the tree folk
Gemeinschaft
Half of him is a city.
If you call him in the forest
You might get the gut side
Vertiginous and quiver,
Covered in vines and hair
To camouflage
What's on the inside that counts?

What fixed and determinate story
Hails from the forest these
Fisted halls?
Most of him is hanging in the tree you
See blinking in the sunlight, such a drip.
The rainwaiter tickles the private.

Got to get it together. 
From formal folk 
Comes the shining.

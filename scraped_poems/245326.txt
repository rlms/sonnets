I've been writing this since
 the summer my grandfather
 taught me how to hold a blade
 of grass between my thumbs
 and make it whistle, since
 I first learned to make green
 from blue and yellow, turned
 paper into snowflakes, believed
a seashell echoed the sea,
 and the sea had no end.
  
 I've been writing this since
a sparrow flew into my class
 and crashed into the window,
 laid to rest on a bed of tissue
 in a shoebox by the swings, since
 the morning I first stood up
 on the bathroom sink to watch
 my father shave, since our eyes
 met in that foggy mirror, since
 the splinter my mother pulled
 from my thumb, kissed my blood.
  
 I've been writing this since
 the woman I slept with the night
 of my father's wake, since
 my grandmother first called me
 a faggot and I said nothing, since
 I forgave her and my body 
 pressed hard against Michael
 on the dance floor at Twist, since
 the years spent with a martini
 and men I knew I couldn't love.
  
 I've been writing this since 
 the night I pulled off the road
 at Big Sur and my eyes caught 
 the insanity of the stars, since 
 the months by the kitchen window
 watching the snow come down
 like fallout from a despair I had
 no word for, since I stopped
 searching for a name and found
 myself tick-tock in a hammock
 asking nothing of the sky.
  
 I've been writing this since 
 spring, studying the tiny leaves
 on the oaks dithering like moths,
 contrast to the eon-old fieldstones
 unveiled of snow, but forever
 works-in-progress, since tonight
 with the battled moon behind
 the branches spying on the world—
 same as it ever was—perfectly
 unfinished, my glasses and pen
 at rest again on the night table.
  
 I've been writing this since 
 my eyes started seeing less,
 my knees aching more, since
 I began picking up twigs, feathers,
 and pretty rocks for no reason 
 collecting on the porch where
 I sit to read and watch the sunset
 like my grandfather did everyday,
 remembering him and how
 to make a blade of grass whistle.

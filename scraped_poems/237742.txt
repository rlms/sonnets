It's now all about money 
about which poetry rarely reaches 
transcendence. But love must still fester 
even under that. Everyone I know
frets if poetry can still matter,
but what about love? It's all become
too much for them, and they're all 
on the soma. It makes sense 
with these pills when the someone
they thought they loved for years
by never thinking about it says, 
“I don't love you anymore,
but let's stay friends in that mellow
woebegone way poetry now 
sings without singing.” Of course, 
they're always asking “What is poetry?”
and then answering by saying 
it's what Boethius was thinking about
when they squished his head
until his eyes popped out, 
or anything barbaric enough to get
everyone to stop eating for a bit
and reach for a moment past 
a chatty moment. Sort of a solution 
to awkward goodbyes. How money 
becomes a sort of welcome 
relief that defuses the poetry 
charging tense moments. “Interesting,”
someone remarks between bites, 
“to be right here in the moment
yet also out there watching 
some once-in-a-lifetime sublimity 
unfold, as if living as if already 
dead.” As if standing in a dream far up 
in the stars somewhere with Scipio

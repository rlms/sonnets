For years he lived close enough to smell 
chicken and bananas rotting 
in the trash bins, to surprise a cashier on break 
smoking something suspicious when he walked
 
out the back gate. Did they have an account? 
He can't remember. Probably so, for all the milk 
a large family went through, the last-minute 
ingredients delivered by a smirking bag boy.
 
He liked to go himself, the parking lot's 
radiant heat erased once he got past the sweating 
glass door, to troll the icy aisles in his slippers. 
This was before high-end labels took over
 
shelf space, before baloney changed 
its name to mortadella, before water 
came in flavors, before fish 
got flown in from somewhere else.

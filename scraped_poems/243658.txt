from the King who is king of all kings,
      the Holy One, blessed be He.

Bless me with peace—
      angels of peace,
            angels of heaven—

      the Holy One, blessed be He,
      in peace be your leaving—
            angels of peace,
                  angels of heaven,
from the King who is king of all kings,
      the Holy One, blessed be He.

                      The rhinestone lights blink off and on. 
Pretend stars. 
I'm sick of explanations. A life is like Russell said 
of electricity, not a thing but the way things behave. 
A science of motion toward some flat surface,
 some heat, some cold. Some light 
can leave some after-image but it doesn't last.
 Isn't that what they say? That and that 
historical events exchange glances with nothingness.

From "Shorter Chaucer Tales" (2006)
The great labour of appearance
Served the making of the pyre. 
But how 
Nor how
How also
How they
Shal nat be toold
Shall not be told.
Nor how the gods
Nor how the beestes and the birds 
Nor how the ground agast
Nor how the fire 
First with straw
And then with drye 
And then with grene 
And then with gold
And then
Now how a site is laid like this.
Nor what
Nor how
Nor how
Nor what she spak nor what was her desir
Nor what jewels
When the fire
Nor how some threw their 
And some their 
And their 
And cups full of wine and milk 
And blood
Into the fyr
Into the fire.
Nor how three times 
And three times with
And three times how.

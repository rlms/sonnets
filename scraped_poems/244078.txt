I had a boyfriend who told me stories about his family, 
how an argument once ended when his father 
seized a lit birthday cake in both hands 
and hurled it out a second-story window. That,
I thought, was what a normal family was like: anger 
sent out across the sill, landing like a gift 
to decorate the sidewalk below. In mine 
it was fists and direct hits to the solar plexus,
and nobody ever forgave anyone. But I believed 
the people in his stories really loved one another, 
even when they yelled and shoved their feet 
through cabinet doors, or held a chair like a bottle 
of cheap champagne, christening the wall,
rungs exploding from their holes. 
I said it sounded harmless, the pomp and fury 
of the passionate. He said it was a curse 
being born Italian and Catholic and when he 
looked from that window what he saw was the moment 
rudely crushed. But all I could see was a gorgeous 
three-layer cake gliding like a battered ship 
down the sidewalk, the smoking candles broken, sunk 
deep in the icing, a few still burning.

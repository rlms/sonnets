Everything measured. A man twists 
a tuft of your hair out for no reason 
other than you are naked before him 
and he is bored with nakedness. Moments 
before he was weighing your gallbladder, 
and then he was staring at the empty space 
where your lungs were. Even dead, we still 
say you are an organ donor, as if something 
other than taxes outlasts death. Your feet 
are regular feet. Two of them, and there is no 
mark to suggest you were an expert mathematician, 
nothing that suggests that a woman loved
you until you died. From the time your body 
was carted before him to the time your 
dead body is being sent to the coffin, 
every pound is accounted for, except 21 grams. 
The man is a praying man and has figured 
what it means. He says this is the soul, finally, 
after the breath has gone. The soul: less than 
$4,000 worth of crack—21 grams— 
all that moves you through this world.

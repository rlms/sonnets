After James Merrill
One evening, tired of games and each other,
we spent watching our reflections on a screen
— four in a two-seater, angling like sardines.
For a dog's hair I'd milked the wine, uttered
words like, “that's the cure!” swiveled
the puckering glass like a mock-dandy,
blood slushing at my temples, until the spill,
a fatal expression on the white and navy,
ruined the smoothness past salvation. A cough
of salt, the patting of the fabric, perhaps enough.

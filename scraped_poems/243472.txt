At the moment of my mother's death 
I am rinsing frozen chicken. 
No vision, no rending 
of the temple curtain, only
the soft give of meat. 
I had not seen her in four days. 
I thought her better, 
and the hospital did not call, 
so I am fresh from 
an office Christmas party, 
scotch on my breath 
as I answer the phone. 
And in one moment all my past acts 
become irrevocable.

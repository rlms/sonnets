Light was on its way
from nothing
to nowhere.

Light was all business

        Light was full speed

when it got interrupted.

Interrupted by what?

When it got tangled up
and broke
into opposite

       broke into brand new things.
    
       What kinds of things?

       Drinking Cup

              “Thinking of you!
                          Convenience Valet”

How could speed take shape?

Hush!
Do you want me to start over?

The fading laser pulse

        Information describing the fading laser pulse

is stored

        is encoded

in the spin states
of atoms.

God 
is balancing his checkbook

        God is encrypting his account.

This is taking forever!

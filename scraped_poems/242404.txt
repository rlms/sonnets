How did I get so old, 
I wonder, 
contemplating 
my 67th birthday. 
Dyslexia smiles:
I'm 76 in fact.

There are places 
where at 60 they start 
counting backwards; 
in Japan 
they start again 
from one.

But the numbers 
hardly matter. 
It's the physics 
of acceleration I mind, 
the way time speeds up 
as if it hasn't guessed

the destination— 
where look! 
I see my mother 
and father bearing a cake, 
waiting for me
at the starting line.﻿

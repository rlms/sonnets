It's too soon for the front porch swing.
No crocuses are opeing.
The wind is from the north and chill.

No matter. Spring is here. I still
Am bound to sit and swing out there
And feel it in the evening air.

It's much too cold. The trees are lean
And leafless—not a sign of green.
It's foolishness to sit outside.

The mockingbird has testified 
To spring's existence, and I see
The buds are on the almond tree.

I'm sure it's spring.

How do you know?

I think a cricket told me so.

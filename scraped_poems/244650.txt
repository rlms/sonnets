The woods are the book 
we read over and over as children. 
Now trees lie at angles, felled 
by lightning, torn by tornados, 
silvered trunks turning back

to earth. Late November light 
slants through the oaks 
as our small parade, father, mother, child, 
shushes along, the wind searching treetops 
for the last leaf. Childhood lies

on the forest floor, not evergreen 
but oaken, its branches latched 
to a graying sky. Here is the scarf 
we left years ago like a bookmark,

meaning to return the next day, 
having just turned our heads 
toward a noise in the bushes, 
toward the dinnerbell in the distance,

toward what we knew and did not know 
we knew, in the spreading twilight 
that returns changed to a changed place.

for J
In my life so much happens
 that I would like to write about, 
but then something else happens 
& things are always happening. 
You, my friend, are underground
 & will always be there. I did not
 help you, but you always helped me. 
When I was an atheist, I believed
 in people. Now as a nihilist, my grief 
has no hope. And I could say
 there is no reason to keep going, 
but then I think of, I think of you.

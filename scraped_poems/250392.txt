there are some people i know
whose beauty
is a crime.
who make you so crazy
you don't know
whether to throw yourself
at them
or kill them.
which makes
for permanent madness.
which could be
bad for you.
you better be on the lookout
for such circumstances.

stay away
from the night.
they most likely lurk
in corners of the room
where they think
they being inconspicuous
but they so beautiful
an aura
gives them away.

stay away
 from the day. 
they most likely
 be walking 
down the street
 when you least 
expect it
 trying to look 
ordinary 
but they so fine
they break your heart
by making you dream 
of other possibilities.

stay away
from crazy music.
they most likely
be creating it.
cuz when you're that beautiful
you can't help
putting it out there.
everyone knows
how dangerous
that can get.

stay away
from magic shows.
especially those
involving words.
words are very
tricky things.
everyone knows
words
the most common
instruments of
illusion.

they most likely
 be saying them, 
breathing poems 
so rhythmic 
you can't help 
but dance.
and once
you start dancing
to words
you might never
stop.

under the gervais st. bridge,
our voices domed   like a cathedral.
shoulders dipped in sunlight,
a baptism of sorts.
we came to take pictures. searched
for subjects like graffiti on piers,
what my mother calls angel     rays
in the sky,      that yellowed, humid
glint in your eyes.
maybe i ran out of film     or
my batteries died      because when
we finally found our shot,
you used your iphone. 
neither of us have a right to decide
what is holy.                       i told you
i was almost a catholic baby,
a half-lie i wanted to be true 
if only because i knew     you would
be disappointed. 
there is no glory in either of our
             doubts: your face when
i talked of  prayer, how
walking across that bridge  back to
your car,             i remembered that
what gives a photo life
is artificial light.

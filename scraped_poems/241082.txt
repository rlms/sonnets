Will my ears grow long as Grandpa's?
 What makes us look like kin?
 Tell me where'd I get long eyelashes
 and where'd I get my chin?
  
 Where'd I get my ice cream sweet tooth
 and this nose that wiggles when I talk?
 Where's I get my dizzy daydreams
 and my foot-rolling, side-step walk?


 Did I inherit my sense of humor
 and these crooked, ugly toes?
 What if I balloon like Uncle Harry
 and have to shave my nose?
  
 How long after I start growing
 until I start to shrink?
 Am I going to lose my teeth,
 some day?
 My hair?
 My mind?
  
 Do you think
 I'll be tall or short or thin
 or bursting at the seams?
 Am I naturally this crazy?
 Is it something in my genes?
  
 I'm more than
 who I am,
 I'm also
 who I'm from.
 It's a scary speculation--                      
 Who will I become?

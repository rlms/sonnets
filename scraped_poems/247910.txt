Hanging out the wash, I visit the cats. 

"I don't belong to nobody," Yang insists vulgarly. 

"Yang," I reply, "you don't know nothing." 

Yin, an orange tabby, agrees 

but puts kindness ahead of rigid truth.

 I admire her but wish she wouldn't idolize

 the one who bullies her. I once did that.

 Her silence speaks needles when Yang thrusts

his ugly tortoiseshell body against hers,

 sprawled in my cosmos. "Really, I don't mind,"

 she purrs—her eyes horizontal, her mouth

 an Ionian smile, her legs crossed nobly

 in front of her, a model of cat Nirvana—

 "withholding his affection, he made me stronger.'

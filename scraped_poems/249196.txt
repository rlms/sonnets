tend their yard every weekend, 
when they paint or straighten
 the purple fencepickets canting 
each other at the edge of their lot,

hammering them down into soil 
to stand. How long will they stay 
put? My neighbors mend their gate, 
hinges rusted to blood-colored dust,

then weave gold party-lights with 
orange lobster-nets & blue buoys 
along the planks. So much to see 
& not see again, each chore undone

before they know it. I love how 
faithfully they work their garden 
all year, scumbling dried eelgrass 
in fall, raking away mulch in spring.

Today the older one, Pat, plants 
weeds ripped from a cranberry-bog. 
Sassafras & pickerel, black locust 
& meadowsweet, wild sarsaparilla,

checkerberry, starflower. Will they 
take root here? Meanwhile Chris waters 
seeds sown months ago. Furrows 
of kale, snap-bean, scallion break 

the surface, greedy for life. Muskrose
& lilac cast their last shadows. Is it
seeing or sun that makes them flicker,
as if they've vanished? They shake


like a letter in someone's hand. 
Here come the guys from Whorfs 
(“Whores”) Court, walking their dog
 —also in drag—to the dunes.


I miss seeing Disorient Express 
(a.k.a. Cheng, out of drag) walk by, 
in tulle & sequins the exact shade 
of bok choi. He must have endured

things no one can name, to name only 
KS, pneumocystis, aplastic anemia. 
I remember he walked off his gurney 
when the ambulance came, then broke

his nurse's fingers in the hospital 
when he tried to change his IV line, 
wanting to live without meds. Zorivax, 
Ativan, leucovorin? I don't know.

Pat & Chris pack down the loose dirt. 
I'll never know what threads hold 
our lives together. They kiss, then fall 
on the grass. I should look away but don't.

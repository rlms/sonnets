When my lover became my enemy 
I made my bed amongst winds 
and drove the old road 'till my heart crashed.
Where's the bypass?

Washing my shirts, wringing them out.
Hung in the breeze. 

Water skips 
                  undressed 
over outcrops.

What it says is.

Wind,
roots in rock. 

Lying on Long Tongue,
sun diffused in mist.
Easy sleep 
without waking.

Edge of 
      displaced echoes 
air around
and sound
      of  bird and 'plane

A swallow's glittering chitter.

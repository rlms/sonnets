for The People
The people don't mention it much. 
It goes without saying, 
it stays without saying—

that concentration camp
 on their reservation.

And they avoid that massive site 
as they avoid contamination—

that massive void 
punctuated by crusted nails,
 punctured pipes, crumbled 
failings of foundations . . .

What else is there to say?

This was a lush land once, 
graced by a gifted people 
gifted with the wisdom 
of rivers, seasons, irrigation.

The waters went flowing 
through a network of canals
 in the delicate workings 
of balances and health . . .

What else is there to say?

Then came the nation. 
Then came the death.

Then came the desert. 
Then came the camp.

But the desert is not deserted. 
It goes without saying,
 it stays without saying—

wind, spirits, tumbleweeds, pain.

The rooster pushes his head 
high among the hens, trying to be 
what he feels he must be, here 
in the confines of domesticity. 
Before the tall legs of my presence, 
he bristles and shakes his ruby comb. 
 
Little man, I want to say 
the hens know who they are. 
I want to ease his mistaken burden, 
want him to crow with the plain 
ecstasy of morning light as it 
finds its winter way above the woods. 
 
Poor outnumbered fellow, 
how did he come to believe 
that on his plumed shoulders 
lay the safety of an entire flock? 
I run my hand down the rippled 
brindle of his back, urge him to relax, 
drink in the female pleasures 
that surround him, of egg laying, 
of settling warm-breasted in the nest 
of this brief and feathered time.

Stairs & rites 
not for the foot

The building 
thinks

Angular rock

Green skyscraper

Black ziggurat

Miniature 
of time

Made 
into altar

Invention 
of the night

Sprouting 
at dawn

Carved rock 
praying 
as it buds

Seeking the seed 
to sprout!

Saliva
in torrents

Cooling waterfall

You redeem your field

Salt head

Stream
of lights

Double reflection

Stone
& water

The same
sprouting

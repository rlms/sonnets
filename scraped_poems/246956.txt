You were whiny and socially unacceptable even 
to loud young men whose first criterion 
for rock and roll was that it strike someone else 
as awful and repulsive and you told 
grim stories about such obscure affairs 
as a man-killing Zamboni and a grudge-
laden marathon runner from Zanzibar

who knifed a man after finishing sixteenth

Each tale sped from you at such anxious rate
sarcastic showtunes abject similes
feel like a piece of burnt black toast

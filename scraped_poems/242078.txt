You who please      your keenness with poems,
read closely here:      can you discover 
this verse's framer?       finishes.
Nobles enjoy it on earth,      but not without end, 
worldly ones.      ﻿ must fail  
﻿ in our strongholds      once our bodies scatter
their loaned treasure,      like ﻿ trickling through fingers.
Then ﻿ and ear      require ﻿ skill 
in night's narrow cell;      ﻿ drives your craft, 
a kingly servitude.      Now can you see
who shrewd words have      shown to men?
             Remember my name,      O you who admire
the sound of this song;      help succor me
and pray for my comfort.      Soon I must pass 
alone, away      to look for a dwelling,
must travel so far      (no telling where!)
beyond this world      to a yet-unknown
place in the earth.      So must each person,
unless he is granted      God-sent grace.
            Let us call to God      again, more eager,
begging his blessing      in this bright creation:
may we be welcomed      to his warm halls,
his home on high.      There is holiest happiness, 
there the king of angels      crowns the pure 
with a perishless prize.      Now his praise endures 
masterful and marvelous,      and his might extends
endless and ageless      over all creation.      finit.

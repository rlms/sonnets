 Snow fallen, another going 
 gone, new come in, open 
 the door:
                   each night I grow 
 young, my friends are well 
 again, my life is all 
 before me,
                    each morning 
 I close a door, another door.

 Cloud on cloud, gray 
 on gray, snow fallen

 on snow, tree on tree 
 on unleafed tree—

 only a river silvered 
 with thin ice and a slash 
 of gold in the late gray sky.

 Grayed snow slush trudge but 

 snow falling coating filling 

 in for absence Present!

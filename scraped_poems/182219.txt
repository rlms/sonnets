Velvet fruit, exquisite square 
I hold up to sniff 
between finger and thumb - 

how you numb me 
with your rich attentions! 
If I don't eat you quickly, 

you'll melt in my palm. 
Pleasure seeker, if i let you 
you'd liquefy everywhere. 

Knotted smoke, dark punch 
of earth and night and leaf, 
for a taste of you 

any woman would gladly 
crumble to ruin. 
Enough chatter: I am ready 

to fall in love!

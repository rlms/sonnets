Night is deep in a dark box
 deep in a cushion of down
 nestled in tissue
 tied with ribbons
 Night is asleep in the dark
  
 Night wakes with curious paws
 wakes in a furry fog
 wrestles the tissue
 nibbles the ribbons 
 Night is awake in the dark
  
 Night tumbles in velvet directions
 tumbles along to your bed
 sniffing your wishes
 wagging your worries
 Night is a friend in the dark

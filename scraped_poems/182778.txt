                   ”Obviously there is much to be said for the 
                   conscious cultivation and extension of taste, but 
                   there is also something to be said for the 
                   functional reaction to artistic design (and 
                   honeysuckles) as normal elements of human 
                   existence.” 
                                                      —Albert Murray

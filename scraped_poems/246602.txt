She kept them high on the top shelf, 
In boxes big as drums—

Bright, crescent-shaped boats 
With little fishnets dangling down—

And wore them with her best dress 
To teas, coffee parties, department stores.

What a lovely catch, my father used to say, 
Watching her sail off into the afternoon waters.

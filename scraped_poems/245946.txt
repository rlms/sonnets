She's with Grandma in front
 of Grandma's house, backed
 by a willow tree, gladiola and roses.

 Who did she ever want
 to please? But Grandma
 seems half-pleased and annoyed.

 No doubt Mother frowns
 behind the lens, wants
 to straighten this sassy face.

 Maybe laughs, too.
 Little girl with her mouth wide,
 tongue out, yelling

 at the camera. See her little
 white purse full of treasure,
 her white sandals?

 She has things to do,
 you can tell. Places to explore
 beyond the frame,

 and these women picking flowers
 and taking pictures.
 Why won't they let her go?

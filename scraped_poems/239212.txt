 
IF the butterfly courted the bee,    
  And the owl the porcupine;    
If churches were built in the sea,    
  And three times one was nine;    
If the pony rode his master,           
  If the buttercups ate the cows,    
If the cats had the dire disaster    
  To be worried, sir, by the mouse;    
If mamma, sir, sold the baby    
  To a gypsy for half a crown;          
If a gentleman, sir, was a lady,—    
  The world would be Upside-down!    
If any or all of these wonders    
  Should ever come about,    
I should not consider them blunders,           
  For I should be Inside-out!    
 

            Chorus

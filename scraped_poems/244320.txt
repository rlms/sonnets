Between the imaginary iceberg and the skeletal whale
is the stuffed and mounted mermaid in her case,
 the crudely-stitched seam between skin and scale
 
so unlike Herbert Draper's siren dreams, loose
on the swelling tide, part virgin and part harpy.
 Her post-mortem hair and her terrible face
 
look more like P.T. Barnum's Freak of Feejee,
 piscene and wordless, trapped in the net of a stare.
 She has the head and shrivelled tits of a monkey,
 
the green glass eyes of a porcelain doll, a pair 
 of praying-mantis hands, and fishy lips
 open to reveal her sea-caved mouth, her rare
 
ivory mermaid-teeth. Children breathe and rap
 on the glass to make her move. In her fixity
 she's as far as can be from the selkie who slips
 
her wet pelt on the beaches of Orkney
 and walks as a woman, pupils widened in light,
 discarding the stuffed sack of her body.
 
Without hearing, or touch, or taste, or smell, or sight
 she echoes the numb roll of the whale
 in a sea congealed with cold, when it was thought
 
no beast could be a nerveless as the whale.

What can be compared to 
                                    the living eye? 
Its East 
             is flowering 
honeysuckle 
                  and its North   
dogwood bushes. 

What can be compared 
                               to light 
in which leaves darken 
                                  after rain, 
fierce green? 
                     like Rousseau's jungle:   
any minute 
                the tiger head 
will poke through 
                           the foliage 
peering 
            at experience. 

Who is like man 
                        sitting in the cell 
of referents, 
                     whose eye   
has never seen 
                      a jungle,   
yet looks in? 

It is the great eye, 
                               source of security. 
Praised be thou, 
                         as the Jews say, 
who have engraved   
                           clarity 
and delivered us 
                         to the mind 
where you must reign 
                               severe 
as quiddity of bone 
                              forever 
and ever without 
                         bias or mercy,   
attrition or mystery.

The songs we join in
are beeswax candles
burning with no smoke
a clean fire licking at the evening


our voices small flames quivering. 
The songs string us like beads 
on the hour. The ritual is
 its own melody that leads us

where we have gone before 
and hope to go again, the comfort 
of year after year. Order: 
we must touch each base

of the haggadah as we pass, 
blessing, handwashing, 
dipping this and that. Voices 
half harmonize on the brukhahs.

Dear faces like a multitude 
of moons hang over the table 
and the truest brief blessing: 
affection and peace that we make.

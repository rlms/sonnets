Even gods, though they were born 
in our own heads, died out to myth.

Just as no one can point to the source 
of the spring or later at sea can say: this

is the water from deep in the earth, that
flowed from the mountaintops, so

is the stream of mortals and gods.

About my origins I know 
nothing. I married the earth, a child

grew in me, fell
out of me at last, and I

babbled: little mutt of mine, I'll
name you, dunk you in invulnerability.

He smiled at me, held me tightly
by the heel and said mama.

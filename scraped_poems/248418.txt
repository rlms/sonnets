(“Died of Wounds”)
Because you died, I shall not rest again, 
     But wander ever through the lone world wide, 
 Seeking the shadow of a dream grown vain 
             Because you died. 
  
 I shall spend brief and idle hours beside 
     The many lesser loves that still remain, 
 But find in none my triumph and my pride; 
  
 And Disillusion's slow corroding stain 
     Will creep upon each quest but newly tried, 
 For every striving now shall nothing gain 
             Because you died.

 for Jane Draycott
As winter secrets
 melt
 
with the purple
 sun,
 
what is revealed
 is electric —
 
notes tune
 unknown scales,
 
syntax alters
 tongues,
 
terracotta melts
 white,
 
banyan ribbons
 into armatures
 
as branch-roots
 twist, meeting
 
soil in a circle.
 Circuits
 
glazed
 under cloth
 
carry
 alphabets
 
for a calligrapher's
 nib
 
italicised
 in invisible ink,
 
letters never
 posted,
 
cartographer's
 map, uncharted —
 
as phrases fold
 so do veils.

By the sparklet of certain ciliates cesium 
    practices its cricket song.

Am I supposed to be impressed? My smoothie 
    comes with gps. 

Take a left at that crustacean. You—yes, you, 
    with the crisis Isis eyes.

By Odin's beard, this is snowier than usual. We can 
    always burn the first folio. 

Go bug a dandelion. You'll have 
    the elephant of surprise.

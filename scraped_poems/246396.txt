Because the dark suit is worn it is worn warm 
    with a black tie 
and a kiss at the head of the stairs

When you hear the dark suit rip 
on the heart's curb the hurt is big 
     rose flesh caught on the orange woman's buttons

As you talk metropole monotone
                  antique intelligence

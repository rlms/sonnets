I heard from people after the shootings. People 
I knew well or barely or not at all. Largely 
the same message: how horrible it was, how little 
there was to say about how horrible it was. 
People wrote, called, mostly e-mailed 
because they know I teach at Virginia Tech,
to say, there's nothing to say. Eventually 
I answered these messages: there's nothing 
to say back except of course there's nothing 
to say, thank you for your willingness 
to say it. Because this was about nothing. 
A boy who felt that he was nothing, 
who erased and entered that erasure, and guns 
that are good for nothing, and talk of guns 
that is good for nothing, and spring 
that is good for flowers, and Jesus for some, 
and scotch for others, and “and” for me 
in this poem, “and” that is good 
for sewing the minutes together, which otherwise 
go about going away, bereft of us and us 
of them. Like a scarf left on a train and nothing 
like a scarf left on a train. As if the train, 
empty of everything but a scarf, still opens 
its doors at every stop, because this 
is what a train does, this is what a man does 
with his hand on a lever, because otherwise, 
why the lever, why the hand, and then it was over, 
and then it had just begun.

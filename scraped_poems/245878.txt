A new embroidery of flowers, canary color,
                        dots the grass already dotty
                        with aster-white and clover.

I warn, “They won't last, out of water.”
The children pick some anyway.

In or out of  water
children don't last either.

I watch them as they pick.
Still free of  what's next
            and what was yesterday
they pick today.

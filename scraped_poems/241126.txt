If you'd seen 
the Gaillardots' mullein in the Cedars of the Shouf; 
if you'd seen the Aleppo dock, red with iron, 
in Bcharre where the Adonis River's said to run as red 

with what was 
thought his blood; if you'd seen the bearded oat in Burjein, 
the rayed white horehound in Tripoli; or maybe 
the milkwort in Ehden, as often I saw the strigose bellflower 

and the cyclamen, 
you might have been the more awed by a mallow-leaved 
bindweed in Aley on your way to the brunnera in Baalbek. 
The Mediterranean poppy in Nabatieh, Beirut mullein 

in nearby Baabda, 
connate Alexanders in Qadisha, fodder vetch in Zgharta,
white rocket in Sour, Gypsywort in Marjeyoun, 
headed Ziziphora in Baakleen, bladder skullcap in Barouk. 

The viscid catchfly, 
ah, vying with bats at evening in Zahleâ€”for these the earth 
of continuous habitation since the Chalcolithic Age 
salivates at dawn. But not a reed grows where no grave is. 

In Sacandaga Valley,
two thousand bodies were trans-buried by the boneyard gang. 
They ceded the pitted ground to the dentist gang, 
whose jackhammers drilled the rock beneath.

Powder monkeys tamped 
the holes with dynamite. The beaver-tooth gang's axes 
and cross-cut saws cleared the trees. Bush burners followed. 
The fires burned for two years. The patience of dam builders 

built a force 
equal to the water: It flooded the ashes, the railroad station, 
and a train, which I saw transposed in the steely swells, 
or so it seemed. But iron turns a torrent red.

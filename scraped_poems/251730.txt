Surely we cannot be ruled by a mad king.  We must dethrone him.”   That evening the king ordered a golden goblet to be filled from the well.  And when it was brought to him he drank deeply, and gave it to his lord chamberlain to drink.   And there was great rejoicing in that distant city of Wirani, because its king and its lord chamberlain had regained their reason.

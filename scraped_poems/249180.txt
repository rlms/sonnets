In life you had a temper. 
Your sarcasm was a whetted knife. 
Sometimes you shuddered with fear 
but you made yourself act no matter 
how few stood with you. 
Open the door for Eliyahu 
that he may come in.

Now you return to us 
in rough times, out of smoke 
and dust that swirls blinding us. 
You come in vision, you come 
in lightning on blackness. 
Open the door for Eliyahu 
that he may come in.

In every generation you return 
speaking what few want to hear 
words that burn us, that cut 
us loose so we rise and go again 
over the sharp rocks upward. 
Open the door for Eliyahu 
that he may come in.

You come as a wild man, 
as a homeless sidewalk orator, 
you come as a woman taking the bima, 
you come in prayer and song, 
you come in a fierce rant. 
Open the door for Eliyahu 
that she may come in.

Prophecy is not a gift, but 
sometimes a curse, Jonah 
refusing. It is dangerous 
to be right, to be righteous. 
To stand against the wall of might. 
Open the door for Eliyahu 
that he may come in.

There are moments for each 
of us when you summon, when 
you call the whirlwind, when you 
shake us like a rattle: then we 
too must become you and rise. 
Open the door for Eliyahu 
that we may come in.

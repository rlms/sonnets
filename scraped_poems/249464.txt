Ever since I was a boy, I've found
names, personalities as brittle, excuse me, as braille
hints of interest, latched to the slightest
meaning. Not parlance. Let me say power.
The days rotate on their hinges. I can say I had
friends. Sizable numbers, without delay, we were
like, I don't know, an absence. A civilization.
Prompt and unlike ourselves at all times: it was as if
we could stand to burst, to rapidly be
our own engines, rules, buildings, steel columns,
iron beams. This is when I said I had a foundry.
I had a scale, a summary and reflection, not
the desire, but the capacity to be
greater in titles and official things. Then I gave
it up. I sunk hillsides and fields and ash dumps.
I ran the concrete forth and I became the swarm,
the throng, corporate in absurdity. Most people
in opposition would say these are
the words I've prepared, while I am a speaker
without my text, let the day surprise me.
If it falls, it's me who gathers from idiosyncrasies
sentences to shape a state and city.

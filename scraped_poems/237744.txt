An old man with a new hat
is running out of pride.
I want to tell the truth
but I don't know how.
The wind is our best pen
and it blows poetry out of the water.

I wait for days and weeks to enter
a feeling that's had years to leave.
The ocean keeps throwing questions
it has all the answers to.
A candle lights a room
and dims the stars.

When all that consoled consoles no longer
loneliness finds a room inside the one it knows.
I am shrinking from the light
and turning into space.
An old man with a new hat
wears his smile in the dark.

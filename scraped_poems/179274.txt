Swung from the toes out, 
Belly-breath riding on the knuckles,   
The ten-pound maul lifts up, 
Sails in an arc overhead, 
And then lifts you! 

It floats, you float, 
For an instant of clear far sight— 
Eye on the crack in the end-grain   
Angle of the oak round 
Stood up to wait to be split. 

The maul falls—with a sigh—the wood   
Claps apart 
                and lies twain— 
In a wink. As the maul 
Splits all, may 

You two stay together.

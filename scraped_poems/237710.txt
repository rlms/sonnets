A grainy predawn dark, early Expressway traffic 
bleeding arterial tail lights across gray water 
and its blue heart. Under Lemon Hill, 
grunts from Boathouse Row, woodshop clunks, 
young men's voices too loud for a day 
exhaling into starless skies, bad boys
after keg night, hungover, push long sculls
into the water and slice its marcelled run, 
a marbled peacock wake behind each stroke
and coxswain counting that muscled steadiness
past the Water Works, Spring Garden Street Bridge
then Girard Avenue Bridge, where on the bank
Eakins sketches Max Schmitt in a single scull,
his light like this, tinfoil blue, where the crews sweat off
last night's lost time but won't row too far north 
to river canals, Manayunk Reach, its towpath,
mules and barges and anthracite from Point Carbon 
to feed stoves and Bessemers in Harrisburg, Pittsburgh

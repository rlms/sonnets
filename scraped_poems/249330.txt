Never let my hands be to any one an occasion to temptation. — ISABEL DE FLORES
She was the joke of the angels—a girl 
crazy enough for God

that she despised her own beauty; who grew bitter herbs 
to mix with her food,

who pinned a garland of roses to her forehead; 
and who, in a fury of desire

concocted a potion of Indian pepper and bark 
and rubbed it on her face, neck, and breasts,

disfiguring herself.
Then, locked away in a dark cell,

where no reflection was possible,
she begged for death to join her with her Master

whom she called Divine Bridegroom, Thorn 
in My Heart, Eternal Spouse.

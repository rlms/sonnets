One example of hierophany is the apparition of angels. 
This is a new word I overheard this morning. It occurs
when the divine realm manifests — or the word intrudes —  
into our quotidian realm. The natural one, an untidy 
fleshliness of the ordinary. Or the sacred and profane
is another way to say this. I asked whether it is a hernia, 
and the answer was no. A herniated condition is viscera 
on viscera — a disc, organs, the skin, or nerves. Besides, 
such a comparison would be profane. A figure of speech 
already exists, I said, in a hieratic silence of cursive 
writing long ago dead. Not long ago, those two phrases 
dwelled in separate worlds. I dare you to use the word 
hernia in a poem, said a friend. So I not only used
the word, I invited God into language. Or God existed 
before language, while God is also the word. Remember, 
all theophanies are forms of  hierophany. However,
the converse is not always true — not all hierophanies
are theophanies — or God visible in our world.

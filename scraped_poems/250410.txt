It's 70 degrees outside but in the drugstore
Christmas music plays over the speakers as 
I stand in line balancing my checkbook 
in my head, stretching things thin until 
my next paycheck when the rent is due. 
The security guard cracks a joke, but 
I wasn't paying attention, so I just smile 
& step forward in line. Images move 
across the screen. When I think about money
 it seems impossible. All over the country
people are moving into the streets 
& we're here in Atlanta starting a new life. 
Darkness surrounds the latest revision
of our shared history. Everything clouded. 
Yesterday 1 couldn't tear myself from the news 
& already today the events have been distorted, 
the numbers downplayed. It's late fall
& in the early morning crispness, the leaves
fall from the trees & cover the sidewalks. 
This new feeling we lack a name for, struggle
manifested in the streets & in parks & on bridges
across the nation. The headlines read
"Protesters clash with police," but as we watched
the live stream, we saw aggression only by officers
dressed in riot gear. We saw people tossed
on the ground, hit with batons,
a woman punched in the face, an eighty-four year old
woman's face drenched in pepper spray.
The images endless in this land of the free.
I'm losing focus, distracted by the newsfeed
on the computer screen, hitting refresh.
The cat paws at my leg, demands its own attention.
This shift entirely unexpected but necessary.
Leaves blot the window. Every so often
I leave & start from scratch, imagine
damaged relationships & sick cities
where there was no damage & no sickness
greater than anywhere else. In Atlanta,
everyone drives. The bartender called us
"hardcore" when we said we'd walked there.
She said, "No one in Atlanta walks anywhere."
Walking home from work in post-daylight
savings time darkness I pass no one on the
sidewalks. I pass the traffic backed up by
the stoplight. The weekend passes too quickly—
I wish it would last longer, which is what this all
is really about: time & my lack of control
over it, my inability to do what I want with it.
And there's a greater futility at work
here too—a greater frustration in my inability
to control my environment or to stop my country
from killing its citizens. The police beat people
standing still, linking arms, holding cardboard signs.
Each day I think more & more about the past,
about where things began to go wrong, where I, too,
began to go wrong. Before I moved, before I
got sick, before I unfriended you on Facebook,
before I decided I no longer loved you,
before New York, before college—thinking back
to childhood when we could run fearless
through the neighborhood at night, when
we didn't think about the future, when we loved
our country because we didn't know better.

The plastic army men are always green.

 They're caught in awkward poses,
 one arm outstretched as if to fire,
 legs parted and forever stuck on a swiggle
 of support, as rigid and green as the boots.

 This one has impressions of pockets,
 a belt, a collar, a grip on tiny binoculars
 intended to enlarge, no doubt, some
 tiny enemy.

 In back, attached to the belt is a canteen
 or a grenade (it's hard to tell). The helmet
 is pulled down low, so as to hide the eyes.

 If I point the arm, the gun, toward me,
 I see that this soldier is very thin.

 It's almost unreal, how thin he is.

So still at heart, 
They respond like water 
To the slightest breeze, 
Rippling as one body,

And, as one mind, 
Bend continually 
To listen: 
The perfect confidants,

They keep to themselves, 
A web of trails and nests, 
Burrows and hidden entrancesâ€” 
Do not reveal

Those camouflaged in stillness 
From the circling hawks, 
Or crouched and breathless 
At the passing of the fox.

In prayer:
quiet opening,
my artery is a thin    
shadow on paper—
margin of long grass, 
ruderal hair, sister to this 
not yet part of our bodies
your lyric corpus of seed
in rough drafts of pine ash,
chaogao or grass calligraphy  
in rough drafts of pine ash—
your lyric corpus of seed 
not yet part of our bodies: 
ruderal hair, sister to this  
margin of long grass, 
shadow on paper, 
my artery is a thin 
quiet opening
in prayer.

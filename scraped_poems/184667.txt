for Patricia Anderson
“To do as Adam did”

through the twilight's fluoride glare Mercury in perihelion   
 
(rotating exactly three times   
 
while circling the sun twice)   
 
to Pluto foot tilt up the slide at either plane   
 
and build a Garden of the brain.   
 
 
 
Internetted eternities, interspersed   
 
with cypresses   
 
ply ringed air about the many spectacled apples there.   
 
Flamestitch niches orb in swivel orb, The Muses thrush at center   
 
turning. Phospheros arborescens they sing   
 
sense's   
 
 
 
struck crystal clarities   
 
to knock the knees   
 
(or scarlet hollyhock, against a near blue sky).   
 
No end of fountains lost among the shrubberies full eye may bare.   
 
Fixed stars   
 
with fireflies jam the lilac.   
 
 
 
The Lord is a delicate hammerer.   
 
Gold hive upon gray matter   
 
He taps synapse (“carrying to”) (“carrying away”)   
 
an immense bronze pinecone moon-knit at the end of a vista   
 
of sunny jets d'eau, silver poplars. All   
 
shivered in a pool.   
 
 
 
Literally, a flowing: form-take-hand   
 
-with-form   
 
(That Which Fasteneth Us)   
 
pillar to pillar the great dance arch itself through all that   
 
is or was or will be, 3/4 time. This will be a glade   
 
at the head of one stream   
 
 
 
and a resonant gnomon before it will stretch regions of signaling   
 
gnat-like resiliencies in the atmosphere   
 
of where we are — 
 
or were.   
 
Or will be, when the mingled frame of mind   
 
of man is celebration.   
 
 
 
Gates, which separate the wings   
 
of tiered ilex, open
 
in caverns of atoms passing from one into another's zenith   
 
of periodic movement, vast helicoidal shift:   
 
a vaulting of arteries
 
beating their heads against the dark.   
 
 
 
This is the body of light. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vertically in a chromatic spread chord   
 
— Elysian elision — 
 
J'avais bâti, dans un rêve, un palais, un château ou des   
 
grottes

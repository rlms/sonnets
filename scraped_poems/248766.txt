The truck grinds by 
and pumps out grit; 
the road glints and 
goes still. 

The barn owl that 
had not finished here
returns. But with
its fill 

of scavenges, 
face ruffled in mulch, 
the vole is lost 
and safe 

so the silent specter 
flits away, its 
moon face to
the moon

and rears unknown 
against a copse, 
claws tipped for 
the strafe 

and something dies
too soon.

That can happen when a nation changes overnight, when those you know turn into a gate of feathers — and the thing about feathers is, they know what's been missed. For years I watch my neighbor's house from others' windows— different countries, various homes, some of brick, some of stone. Some never imagine what a home can mean when an unfinished tune traps the ceiling. I pretend never to have seen a body midair, a father's hands planted on the ground— after all what we don't admit to never happened. But I couldn't change that day in Murcia, when water brought light to the door: I am seven it is the day before our departure, the day my father gives me a notebook, and I tell him, this is where I'll keep my country.

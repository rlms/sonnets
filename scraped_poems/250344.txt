God banish from your house 
The fly, the roach, the mouse

That riots in the walls 
Until the plaster falls;

Admonish from your door
 The hypocrite and liar;

No shy, soft, tigrish fear 
Permit upon your stair,

Nor agents of your doubt. 
God drive them whistling out.

Let nothing touched with evil, 
Let nothing that can shrivel

Heart's tenderest frond, intrude 
Upon your still, deep blood.

Against the drip of night 
God keep all windows tight,

Protect your mirrors from 
Surprise, delirium,

Admit no trailing wind
Into your shuttered mind

To plume the lake of sleep
With dreams. If you must weep

God give you tears, but leave
You secrecy to grieve,

And islands for your pride,
And love to nest in your side.

We're out
past the end

game where things
get fuzzy,

less thingy,

though in past times
we practiced

precision 
concrete as a slot machine.

But to be precise
you need to stop

a moment
which turns out to be

impracticable
and besides

speed is of the essence. 

Don't worry.

“Of” can take care 
of itself

and it's fine 
to say “essence”

now that it's understood
to mean ether,

a kind of filler
made either 

of inattention
or absorption

somewhere near
the Planck length

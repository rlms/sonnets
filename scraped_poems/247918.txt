I'm sorry I cannot say I love you when you say 

you love me. The words, like moist fingers, 

appear before me full of promise but then run away 

to a narrow black room that is always dark, 

where they are silent, elegant, like antique gold, 

devouring the thing I feel. I want the force 

of attraction to crush the force of repulsion 

and my inner and outer worlds to pierce 

one another, like a horse whipped by a man. 

I don't want words to sever me from reality. 

I don't want to need them. I want nothing

 to reveal feeling but feelingâ€”as in freedom,

 or the knowledge of peace in a realm beyond, 

or the sound of water poured in a bowl.

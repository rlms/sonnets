We never know if the turn
 is into the home stretch. 
We call it that—a stretch 
of place and time— 
with vision of straining,
 racing.  We acknowledge 
each turn with cheers 
though we don't know 
how many laps remain. 
But we can hope the course
 leads on far and clear 
while the horses have strength 
and balance on their lean legs, 
fine-tuned muscles, desire 
for the length of the run. 
Some may find the year smooth, 
others stumble at obstacles 
along the way.  We never know 
if the finish line will be reached 
after faltering, slowing, 
or in mid-stride, leaping forward.

For Hayden Carruth
Thought thrusts up, homely as a hyacinth    
wrapped in its bulb like a root-vegetable,    
a ninth-month    
belly, where the green indelible    
pattern's inscribed into the labyrinth.    
Thrust into light, it's air's inhabitant    
with light and air as food and drink.    
A hyacinth, tumescent pink    
on the low wooden Mexican chest    
confronts the wintry dusk    
with informed self-interest.    
Leaf-spears extravagantly ask    
what idea, still gnarled up in a knot    
of ganglions, will break through the husk    
shaped at last, recognizable as thought.

Trace, on a city map, trajectories    
of partially-forgotten words    
along the river's arteries,    
volatile substance of a sentient world.    
Mauve heather crowds the window-grill. The light    
lingers a little later, with a slight    
vernal inflection. In a moon-glazed vase    
bloom yellow freesias, like some rainy day's    
brook-bank, in someone else's memory.    
Small whirlpools of perception widen, ring    
an infant's numinous discoveries    
of syllables for animals, toys, trees:    
a Lab's thick coat, the dusty birds    
in Claremont Park each tardy urban spring,    
a stuffed pink leather horse with button eyes.

A question-mark in yellow overalls,    
I could read. I was three.    
I slept with that pink horse. My one doll's    
name was V. J. She'd been given to me    
to celebrate the Victory    
over Japan, that is to say, the Bomb    
I'd spend my schooldays taking shelter from.    
I couldn't tie my shoes. But Reddy the fox,    
Tootle the engine who jumped off the tracks,    
spelled me their stories on my mother's lap    
despite weak eyes and poor small-motor skills.    
My grandparents were dead: not in pogroms,    
not in the camps—of strokes and heart attacks,    
merely immigrants, not deportees.    
"When you die, does everything just stop?"

I'm four, in itchy woolen leggings,    
the day that I can't recognize the man    
down at the park entrance, waving,    
as my father. He has ten    
more years to live, that spring. Dapper and balding    
he walks toward me; then I run toward him, calling    
him, flustered by my flawed vision.    
Underfoot, the maples' green-    
winged seeds splay on mica-specked octagons.    
His round face, thin nose, moustache silvered gray    
at thirty-eight look (I think now) Hungarian.    
I like his wood-smell of two packs a day    
as he swings me up to his shoulder    
and I say, things look blurry far away    
—one Saturday, two years after the war.

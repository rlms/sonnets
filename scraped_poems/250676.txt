A silver watch you've worn for years 
 is suddenly gone, leaving a pale 
 white stripe blazing on your wrist. 
  
 A calendar, marked with appointments 
 you've meant to keep, disappears, leaving 
 a faded spot on the wall where it hung. 
  
 You search the house, yard, trash cans 
 for weeks, but never find it. 
  
 One night the glass in your windows 
 vanishes,  
 leaving you sitting in a gust of wind. 
  
 You think how a leg is suddenly lost 
 beneath a subway train, or taxi's wheel, 
 some slippery afternoon. 
  
 The child you've raised for years, 
 combing each lock, tailoring each smile, 
 each tear, each valuable thought, 
  
 suddenly changes to a harlequin, 
 joins the circus passing in the street, 
 never to be seen again. 
  
 One morning you wash your face, 
 look into the mirror, find the water 
 has eroded your features, worn them 
  
 smooth as a rock in a brook. 
 A blank oval peers back at you, 
 too mouthless to cry out.

At IHOP, after the skinny brunette 
with a band-aid covering her hickey 
comes to whisk away burnt toast, 
Mom mentions Theresa, face 
brightening. She had a dream
about herâ€”80s flip hair, smooth 
complexion. I've been living 
in Tulsa for eighteen years, 
Theresa said. I understand. 
Even as I watched men lower 
her casket, I fantasized the witness 
protection program had resettled her.

How funny we look, mother 
and daughter laughing over 
scrambled eggs, tears dripping 
onto bacon, hands hugging 
coffee mugs. For a moment Mom felt 
Theresa there. Such faith. Freshen 
your cup? the waitress asks me, poised 
to pour. Cloudy in the cold coffee,
my reflection. I offer the mug.

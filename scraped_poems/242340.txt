On hot days we would see them 
leaving the hive in swarms. June and I 
would watch them weave their way 
through the sugarberry trees toward the pond 
where they would stop to take a drink, 
then buzz their way back, plump and full of water, 
to drop it on the backs of the fanning bees. 
If you listened you could hear them, their tiny wings 
beating in unison as they cooled down the hive. 
My brother caught one once, its bulbous body 
bursting with water, beating itself against 
the smooth glass wall of the canning jar. 
He lit a match, dropped it in, but nothing 
happened. The match went out and the bee
 swam through the mix of sulfur and smoke 
until my brother let it out. It flew straight 
back to the hive. Later, we skinny-dipped 
in the pond, the three of us, the August sun 
melting the world around us as if it were 
wax. In the cool of the evening, we walked 
home, pond water still dripping from our skin, 
glistening and twinkling like starlight.ï»¿

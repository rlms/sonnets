yours is not the majestic    Gypsy
the Codling    Luna    Wax    or grander

Atlas    with the appetite
of a plague     entire fields

succumbing to them    whole
generations of bees    this is

the unseen    closeted    unassuming
gray that seeks out last winter's

cloth    another season    drawn
to the body's scent    what was 

its heat    to consume early    that scant
much of you    fragile    lace-like

the constellate    erasures    of the coat
it makes for you to wear

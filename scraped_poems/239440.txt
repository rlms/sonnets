They told me there'd be pain

so when I felt it, 
sitting at my beat-up farm desk

that looks out glass doors 

onto the browning gardenâ€”plain sparrows 
bathing in the cube-shaped fountain

so violently they drain it, 

the white-throats with their 
wobbly two-note song 

on the long way south still, 

and our dogs 
out like lights and almost 

falling off their chairs

freed of the real-time for awhile
as time began for me

to swell, slow down, carry me out 

of all this almost 
to a where

about as strong a lure as love.

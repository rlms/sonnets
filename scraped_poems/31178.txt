If you believe in the magic of language, 
then Elvis really Lives 
and Princess Diana foretold I end as car spin. 

If you believe the letters themselves 
contain a power within them, 
then you understand 
what makes outside tedious, 
how desperation becomes a rope ends it. 

The circular logic that allows senator to become treason, 
and treason to become atoners. 

That eleven plus two is twelve plus one, 
and an admirer is also married. 

That if you could just rearrange things the right way 
you'd find your true life, 
the right path, the answer to your questions: 
you'd understand how the Titanic 
turns into that ice tin, 
and debit card becomes bad credit. 

How listen is the same as silent, 
and not one letter separates stained from sainted.

1. The Letter 

Everywhere the windows give up nothing 
but frost's intricate veined foliage. 
Just engines shrilling pocked and frozen streets 
wailing toward some new disaster.   
No bright angels' ladders going to split 
heaven this Chicago instant where the pier's   
an iced fantastic: spiked, the glacial floes 
seize it greedy like a careless treasure— 

marquise diamonds, these round clear globes, the psychic's 
crystal world spinning in her corner shop 
when I passed, a globe boundaried with turning 
silent winds and demons. Out here the pavement's 
a slick graffitied strip: There's more to life 
than violence.

For our own private reasons 
We live in each other for an hour. 
Stranger, I take your body and its seasons, 
Aware the moon has gone a little sour 

For us. The moon hangs up there like a stone 
Shaken out of its proper setting. 
We lie down in each other. We lie down alone 
and watch the moon's flawed marble getting 

Out of hand. What are the dead doing tonight? 
The padlocks of their tongues embrace the black, 
Each syllable locked in place, tucked out of sight. 
Even this moon could never pull them back, 

Even if it held them in its arms 
And weighed them down with stones, 
Took them entirely on their own terms 
And piled the orchard's blossom on their bones. 

I am aware of your body and its dangers. 
I spread my cloak for you in leafy weather 
Where other fugitives and other strangers 
Will put their mouths together.

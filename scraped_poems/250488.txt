An idea is sometimes sweetened by refusing to be expressed,
if it attends, solicitously, to this failure, and urges us on to
discover the true impediment to its adaptation. In that
spirit, and bearing that intention within us, we note here, as
elsewhere, there are generally three alternative courses. The
ﬁrst is simply to accept without question an explanation
someone in our proximity, and whom we know, proffers and
then elects to modify out of concern that small details are
escaping to set up camp opposite what is being said. The
second is to surrender one's reluctance to withdraw from the
presence of an unsolved problem by grabbing crudely at
vacant affirmations that nothing further need be done, that
everything to be accomplished was accomplished well before
current advocates approached the threshold, coaxed forward
by the desire to indulge their own vanity. The third is to
remain absolutely uncommitted to any speciﬁc course, and
to insist that the process begin anew each time, contending
that no information will ever be adequate to the task of
judgment, that the requirements, as they evolve, will make
each element moot, or at a minimum place the likelihood
of resolution in ever greater doubt over time, with the
paradoxical effect that the impulse to continue is not
thereby diminished, only channeled into a narrower, more
determined form. Although no beneﬁts are likely to accrue
from this last course, it's unquestionably the one most often
followed, owing perhaps to people's need to test the strength
of a membrane designed to repel assault, or their perennial
enchantment with kaleidoscopic complications spreading
over the earth, as time walks through the sky.

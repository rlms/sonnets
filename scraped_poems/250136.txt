 Did I say I was a creature
 of habit?
  
 I meant the opposite.
  
 I meant behavior
 is a pile of clothes
  
 I might or might not wear.
  
 Before all the sowing and reaping
 could go on for centuries,
  
 before the calendar,
 I must have been convinced
  
 that my movements
 were both mandated
  
 and blessed.

 I've never been an old woman
 knitting by a fire
  
 but I've played one
 in images
  
 where it meant being foolish
 or wise, a mistress
  
 of distraction's
 indirection.
  
 To rock while entwining
 is life's work,
  
 but I am reckless,
 restless

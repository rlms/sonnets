When I sleep I see a child 

hidden between the legs of a scarred man,


their sunburnt backs breathe cold air, 

the child faces me


and the pier's roof swallows the moon

cut by the clouds behind them.


Sometimes, they're on the same roof

wearing handkerchiefs


and uniformed men surround them.

I mistake bullet casings


for cormorant beaks diving

till water churns the color of sunsets,


stained barnacles line the pier

and I can't see who's facedown


on boats lulled by crimson ripples.

Once, I heard the man —


alive and still on the roof — say 

today for you, tomorrow for me.


There's a village where men train cormorants

to fish: rope-end tied to sterns,


another to necks, so their beaks

won't swallow the fish they catch.


My father is one of those birds.

He's the scarred man.

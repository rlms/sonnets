A blue stain
creeps across
the deep pile
of the evergreens.
From inside the
forest it seems
like an interior
matter, something
wholly to do
with trees, a color
passed from one
to another, a
requirement
to which they
submit unflinchingly 
like soldiers or 
brave people
getting older. 
Then the sun 
comes back and
it's totally over.

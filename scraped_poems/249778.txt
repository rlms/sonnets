Love's last urgency is earth 
and grief is all gravity

and the long fall always
 back to earliest hours

that exist nowhere 
but in one's brain.

From the hard-packed
 pile of old-mown grass,

from boredom, from pain,
 a boy's random slash

unlocks a dark ardor 
of angry bees

that link the trees
and block his way home.

I like to hold him holding me, 
mystery mastering fear,

so young, standing unstung 
under what survives of sky.

I learned too late how to live. 
Child, teach me how to die.

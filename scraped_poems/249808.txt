I am not your mother, I will not be moved 
by the grief or gratitude of men 
who weep like orphans at my door. 
I am not a church. I do not answer 
prayers but I never turn them down.

Come in and kneel or sit or stand,
 the burden of your weight won't lessen 
no matter the length of your admission. 
Tell me anything you want, I have to listen 
but don't expect me to respond

when you tell me you have lost your job 
or that your wife has found another love 
or that your children took their laughter 
to another town. You feel alone and empty? 
Color me surprised! I didn't notice they were gone.

Despite the row of faces pinned like medals 
to my walls, I didn't earn them. 
The scratches on the wood are not my scars. 
If there's a smell of spices in the air 
blame the trickery of kitchens
 
or your sad addiction to the yesterdays
that never keep no matter how much you believe
they will. I am not a time capsule.
I do not value pithy things like locks
of hair and milk teeth and ticket stubs

and promise rings—mere particles 
of dust I'd blow out to the street if I could
 sneeze. Take your high school jersey 
and your woman's wedding dress away 
from me. Sentimental hoarding bothers me.

So off with you, old couch that cries 
in coins as it gets dragged out to the porch. 
Farewell, cold bed that breaks its bones 
in protest to eviction or foreclosure or 
whatever launched this grim parade

of exits. I am not a pet. I do not feel
 abandonment. Sometimes I don't even see you 
come or go or stay behind. My windows
 are your eyes not mine. If you should die 
inside me I'll leave it up to you to tell

the neighbors. Shut the heaters off 
I do not fear the cold. I'm not the one 
who shrinks into the corner of the floor
 because whatever made you think 
this was a home with warmth isn't here

to sweet-talk anymore. Don't look at me
 that way, I'm not to blame. I granted 
nothing to the immigrant or exile 
that I didn't give a bordercrosser or a native 
born. I am not a prize or a wish come true.

I am not a fairytale castle. Though I 
used to be, in some distant land inhabited 
by dreamers now extinct. Who knows 
what happened there? In any case, good 
riddance, grotesque fantasy and mirth.
 
 So long, wall-to-wall disguise in vulgar 
suede and chintz. Take care, you fool, 
and don't forget that I am just a house, 
a structure without soul for those whose 
patron saints are longing and despair.

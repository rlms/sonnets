The planet turns there without you, beautiful.
Exiled by death you cannot
touch it. Weird joy to watch postulates

lived out and discarded, something crowded 
inside us always craving to become something
 glistening outside us, the relentless planet

showing itself the logic of what is 
buried inside it. To love existence
 is to love what is indifferent to you

you think, as you watch it turn there, beautiful. 
World that can know itself only by 
world, soon it must colonize and infect the stars.

You are an hypothesis made of flesh. 
What you will teach the stars is constant 
rage at the constant prospect of not-being.

Sometimes when I wake it's because I hear 
a knock. Knock, 
Knock. Two 
knocks, quite clear.

I wake and listen. It's nothing.

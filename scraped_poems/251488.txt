Always fatal, Tay-Sachs disease affectsonly Eastern European children.                                          For R.N.B.
Over the waves of his chest, 
 you watch the sun go up, again. How 
 accidentally the birds cross it!
 How seemingly accidental.
  
 What random choices led you
 to him—your darling 
 from the same steppes
as Zhivago's, and your own.
  
 Then he's dressed, and you're almost.
 Leaning over, he pulls your slip up
 to put his hand over that fat part of you,
 where swims the swimmer. Enter

                                                       Tay and Sachs,

 two men good at identifying
             a certain kind of certain death
                         due to a certain mix of genes
                                     of children with certain parents.
  
 Today you go to determine your chances,
 rather, its chances,
 all euphemism unable to cover
 the chance red spot on the growing retina.
  
 After your doctor has his way,
 you can see on the screen
 the little swimmer trying to escape,
 holding the needle with both hands,
                                                                     just reflex.

                                      The verdict
 takes time to swell and ripen.
 The doctor offers his only balm, a curse:
 knowledge without antidote. All you know
  
 is that the immortals throw no bones,
 that you inherit nothing
 but genes and bravery, both faltering.
 You trot back
  
 to work and your new belly
 swirls with the fetal pig you took the eyes from,
 grade ten. To market, to market.
 You pull your goddamn shrinking coat
  
 around you. Nothing like
 the stir of life that has no chance.
 You shrug. It's only the size of your finger,
 you don't care—
  
                                     But knowing at the end
 of ten hours' pitched screaming,
 your insides reversing, you get
                                                           nothing—
             
             What goes where with death?
 You know all about life.
 You majored in biology, pirouetted
 through the wedding night.
  
 Does it make sounds yet?
 Choose happiness but accept the truth:
 the child might die, you tell your husband.
                                                      Suffer and die.
  
 In the three-week wait you type 
 and each hammer moves the days along.
 Waiting, every word from everyone hurts,
 every Good day,
  
                         careless or concerned,
 every word. The only sympathy you want 
 is the same cruelty shared, all else
 grates. Inside, it spins—in fear?
  
 What you must swallow
 is the sugar cube of your continuing,
 the inescapable desire to pee
 that stirs you mornings, hours before dawn.
  
 But if,
              at the end of these weeks of waiting,
 the white-masked priests come back bearing
 no news, which is their best,
  
 you will have brushed off death,
 rimed him bright and acceptable                     
                                          and seen it slant.
 Either way.

                          That is, what happens
 doesn't matter. You eat.
 You lie down. The sun shrinks.
              The daily din you're thankful for
  
 rescinds its paper currency that nothing backs up.
               Your husband puts on a pot to boil, and another. He can't 
 feel it inside, though he's eaten the same sour apple,
 bearing half the genes,
  
 those underclothes, the bra, the brief
 of the body. You are dumb
 before his helplessness. The cord to belly to cord 
 will not be broken,
  
 ripped untimely as it may be.
 Mama has happened
                              and the rocking horse of your heart
 heaves on.

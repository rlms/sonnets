This is what I see: 

a grain of wheat in the hand of a small boy 

barefoot on the unnamed roads, 
sleeping in the dream another is having.

 An oud, a violin, a guitar, 
a mirror of dew, 

a man about to undress, 
a woman staring.

 A traveler 
returning 
everywhere 

and forgetfulness 
stealing from itself.

Maktoub, the Moor says, 
we hold clouds in our mouth 
and imagine God in our breath.

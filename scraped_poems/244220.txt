I passed through, I should have paused,
there were a hundred doors. One opened. 
In there, someone whose name 
is not yet known to me lived out 

his middle years in simple terms, two chairs, 
one place laid for early breakfast, one plate 
with dry toast and butter softening. There 
his mind raced through writings 

he had memorized long ago while he tried 
to get hold of himself. Once 
in his youth he had studied with love 
in the corners of old paintings 

matrices of fields and towns, 
passages intricate and particular, wheat, 
columns, figures and ground,
classically proportioned 

in lines that were meant 
to meet, eventually,
at vanishing point. They continued,
nevertheless; they troubled the eye.

He collected sets of books printed
in the nineteenth century, unyielding
pages, memoirs of the poets,
engravings of rurified private subjects 

in times of public sector unhappiness,
frescoes of human oddity in gatefold printing.
Why does it continue
to chasten me, he says to no one. 

It does. It is a painful mistaking,
this setting something down,
saying aloud, “it is nothing yet”
when he'd meant, not anything— 

but then nothing peered 
through the keyhole, nothing
took possession. Snow on the roofs,
snow in traces on the ground, 

passersby with wet trouser-cuffs 
looking to the pavement as the hill rises,
light gathering in the river 
and gradually spreading.

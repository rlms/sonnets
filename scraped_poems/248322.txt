When roaring gloom surged inward and you cried,
 Groping for friendly hands, and clutched, and died,
 Like racing smoke, swift from your lolling head
 Phantoms of thought and memory thinned and fled.
  
 Yet, though my dreams that throng the darkened stair
 Can bring me no report of how you fare,
 Safe quit of wars, I speed you on your way
 Up lonely, glimmering fields to find new day,
 Slow-rising, saintless, confident and kind—
 Dear, red-faced father God who lit your mind.

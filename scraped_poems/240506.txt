When her recorded voice on the phone 
said who she was again and again to the piles 
of newspapers and magazines and the clothes 

in the chairs and the bags of unopened mail 
and garbage and piles of unwashed dishes.

When she could no longer walk 
through the stench of it, in her don't-need-nobody-
to-help-me way of walking, with her head 

bent down to her knees as if she were searching 
for a dime that had rolled into a crack 

on the floor, though it was impossible to see 
the floor. When the pain in her foot she disclosed
to no one was so bad she could not stand 

at her refrigerator packed with food and sniff 
to find what was edible. When she could hardly 

even sit as she loved to sit, all night 
on the toilet, with the old rinsed diapers 
hanging nearby on the curtainless bar 

of the shower stall, and the shoes lined up
in the tub, falling asleep and waking up 

while she cut out newspaper clippings 
and listened to the late-night talk 
on her crackling radio about alien landings 

and why the government had denied them. 
When she drew the soapy rag across the agonizing 

ache of her foot trying over and over to wash
the black from her big toe and could not
because it was gangrene.  

When at last they came to carry my mother 
out of the wilderness of that house

and she lay thin and frail and disoriented
between bouts of tests and X-rays, 
and I came to find her in the white bed 

of her white room among nurses who brushed 
her hair while she looked up at them and smiled

with her yellow upper plate that seemed to hold
her face together, dazed and disbelieving, 
as if she were in heaven, 

then turned, still smiling, to the door 
where her stout, bestroked younger brother 

teetered into the room on his cane, all the way 
from Missouri with her elderly sister 
and her bald-headed baby brother, 

whom she despised. When he smiled back
and dipped his bald head down to kiss her, 

and her sister and her other brother hugged her
with serious expressions, and her childish 
astonishment slowly changed 

to suspicion and the old wildness returned
to her eye because she began to see
 
this was not what she wanted at all, 
I sitting down by her good ear holding her hand 
to talk to her about going into the home

that was not her home, her baby brother winking,
the others nodding and saying, Listen to Wesley. 

When it became clear to her that we were not 
her people, the ones she had left behind 
in her house, on the radio, in the newspaper 

clippings, in the bags of unopened mail, 
in her mind, and she turned her face away 

so I could see the print of red on her cheek 
as if she had been slapped hard. 
When the three of them began to implore 

their older sister saying, Ruth, Ruth, 
and We come out here for your own good, 

and That time rolls around for all of us, 
getting frustrated and mad because they meant, 
but did not know they meant, themselves too.

When the gray sister, the angriest of them, 
finally said through her pleated lips 

and lower plate, You was always 
the stubborn one, we ain't here to poison you, 
turn around and say something. 

When she wouldn't.

We had been married for six or seven years 
when my wife, standing in the kitchen one afternoon, told me
that she screams underwater when she swims—

that, in fact, she has been screaming for years
into the blue chlorinated water of the community pool
where she does laps every other day.  

Buttering her toast, not as if she had been 
concealing anything, 
not as if I should consider myself

personally the cause of her screaming,
nor as if we should perform an act of therapy  
right that minute on the kitchen table,

—casually, she told me, 
and I could see her turn her square face up 
to take a gulp of oxygen,

then down again into the cold wet mask of the unconscious.
For all I know, maybe everyone is screaming 
as they go through life, silently,

politely keeping the big secret 
that it is not all fun
to be ripped by the crooked beak

of something called psychology,
to be dipped down 
again and again into time;

that the truest, most intimate 
pleasure you can sometimes find
is the wet kiss 

of your own pain.
There goes Kath, at one pm, to swim her twenty-two laps
back and forth in the community pool; 

—what discipline she has!
Twenty-two laps like twenty-two pages, 
that will never be read by anyone.

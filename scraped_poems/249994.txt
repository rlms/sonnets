It seems a certain fear underlies everything. 
If I were to tell you something profound
 it would be useless, as every single thing I know
 is not timeless. I am particularly risk-averse.

I choose someone else over me every time, 
as I'm sure they'll finish the task at hand, 
which is to say that whatever is in front of us
 will get done if I'm not in charge of it.

There is a limit to the number of times 
I can practice every single kind of mortification 
(of the flesh?). I can turn toward you and say yes, 
it was you in the poem

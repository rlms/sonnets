The pack is filing 
from my nowheresvilles
filling the halfway hotels, 
braving the ruts and calling 
one another via satellite. 
A dollar says hello.

At home I try growing
a new life, one of many 
women bored by 
my womb's mystery. 

Who has time 
to run a thumb 
between her legs
and calculate 
the temperature —
chipper and bitter
netherworld weathergirl.

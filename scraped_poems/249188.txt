It's snowing this afternoon and there are no flowers. 
There is only this sound of falling, quiet and remote, 
Like the memory of scales descending the white keys 
Of a childhood piano—outside the window, palms! 
And the heavy head of the cereus, inclining, 
Soon to let down its white or yellow-white.

Now, only these poor snow-flowers in a heap, 
Like the memory of a white dress cast down . . . 
So much has fallen.
                                    And I, who have listened for a step 
All afternoon, hear it now, but already falling away, 
Already in memory. And the terrible scales descending 
On the silent piano; the snow; and the absent flowers 
      abounding.

In another poem, called The Logic of Spring,
        a mechanical drawing of a tree 
that I've passed a 100 times
         on my way to a different problem. 
I glance backwards, and the stack of the day
 multiplies, glancing backwards several times, 
the dog-eared corner with the graph paper sky of that morning
        and the logic of spring. 
Right before I wake, I hear the riposte of mean jays (blue dots
        that drag the pink banners of answers off the tree
 with words in gold italic latin)
        from the fog pumped in by the machine
 set on my lawn. First thing in the morning,
 (page numbers in all the dish rags hanging around the sink)
         I part the buttery curtains
 to see beyond the doric columns sitting on my porch & the
         hibiscus twig 
that someone has set the stump of such a tree—gray
         smudges and still intact line breaks
 with flashing pink splashes— 
outside my house while I slept.
 Seems unbearably cruel until
I realize that in the flapping fog I finally hear its questions. 
Are you so easily distracted
         by pieces of a poem 
attached to a tree?
         in which as the situation changes
 you catch glimpses of yourself 
         a series of emoticons.

The newspaper caption read: “Two  officers talk to a young man, name withheld, as he stands on a bridge  above the Merrimack River, distraught over learning that his mother is  terminally ill.”
When I first saw you 
I could glance up from your image in the paper
and out her kitchen doorway watch
my mother trim her artemisia,
scraps of silver trailing
her green wheelbarrow.
And I imagined yes,
if mine were dying,
I would be on the abutment too,
about to release the cable
ignoring those attempting rescue

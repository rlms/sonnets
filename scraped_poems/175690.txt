decreed my mother-in-law as my husband 
passed the platter of inward-turning 
soft-skulled Martian baby 
heads around the table, 

and they were O so shyly slyly 
jostling each other with their boiled- 
green sardonic gossip 
(what was the news they told?) 

when he sharply answered, “Mother, 
have you ever 
eaten an artichoke?” 
                               “No,” 

she said, majestic, “but I just know 
I don't care for them, don't 
care for them at all”— 
for truly, if they weren't Martian 

they were at the least Italian 
from that land of “smelly cheese” 
she wouldn't eat, that land of oily 
curves and stalks, unnerving pots 

of churning who knows what, 
and she, nice, Jewish, from the Bronx, 
had fattened on her Russian- 
Jewish mother's kugel, kosher 

chicken, good rye bread .... 
Bearded, rosy, magisterial 
at forty-five, he laughed, 
kept plucking, kept on 

licking those narcissistic 
leaves, each with its razor point 
defending the plump, the tender 
secret at the center, each 

a greave or plate of edible 
armor, so she smiled too, 
in the flash of dispute, 
knowing he'd give her ice cream later, 

all she wanted, as the rich 
meal drew to an end 
with sweets dished out in the lamplit 
circle, to parents, children, grandma— 

the chocolate mint she craved, 
and rocky road he bought especially 
for her, whose knees were just 
beginning to crumble from arthritis, 

whose heart would pump more creakily 
each year, whose baby 
fat would sag and sorrow 
as her voice weakened, breathing 

failed until she too 
was gathered into the same 
blank center 
where her son 

at sixty bearded still, still 
laughing, magisterial 
(though pallid now) 
had just a year before 

inexplicably settled.

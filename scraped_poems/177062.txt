He lived—childhood summers 
    thru bare feet 
then years of money's lack 
    and heat 

beside the river—out of flood 
    came his wood, dog, 
woman, lost her, daughter— 
    prologue 

to planting trees. He buried carp 
    beneath the rose 
where grass-still 
    the marsh rail goes. 

To bankers on high land 
    he opened his wine tank. 
He wished his only daughter 
    to work in the bank 

but he'd given her a source 
    to sustain her— 
a weedy speech, 
    a marshy retainer.

a wren,
perched on a hawthorn
low enough to skip
the scalping winds,
sang a scalpel song

seafrets drift
sheer along shorelines

listening to hail spray glass
and wind
and a waitress laugh
in a cafe without customers
I fell to fell thinking

                         * * * 

a sullen light through vapor
thins a line of hills

the edge of everything is nothing 
whipped by wind

watched on a webcam
bound to a bedpost 
gag on my shaft

rose blush of road-kill rabbit 
insides out on tarmacadam

                         * * * 

cumulus in a tarn
its fast shadow
flees far hills

a wave of sleek grass
skiffs mist 

my hand thought of her 
a photograph 
waiting to happen

                         * * * 

this come-to-kill wind
rips at the root 

here she comes
and there she goes
rushes bow to rime

I should shut down
close off
stop 
if I could

how quick the mist 
how quick

my lover, the assassin, 
is beautiful

she has come to kill me 
and I concur

just now she sleeps
but when she wakes I'm dead

her eyelids flitter 
as I prepare her potions, 
her delicious poisons 

                         * * * 

as she flew past a lick 
of her melodic nectar 
stuck to my wing, 
making flight, for an instant, 
sticky 

but nothing preening couldn't fix

                         * * * 

she asked about my heart,
its evasive flight;
but can I trust her with its secrets?

and does the merlin, in fast pursuit of its prey,
tell the fleeing lark
it is enamored of its song? 

or the singing lark turn tail 
and fly into the falcon's talons?

                         * * * 

my heart, the cartographer, charts 
to the waterline, 
is swept back as the tide turns 
wiping the map blank, wave 
after moon-drawn wave

but it beats, my heart, 
of its own volition

a lark sings winds rush reeds
walking home I stride these tracks 
with her tread

the blurred thumbprint
of a smudged moon

it has gone on for days

strumming rushes
taking up tales, 
taking them on

the fall of my foot, 
on tufts

a stroke of light along a law lain in under a long cloud

I accrete—lichen to limestone
sphagnum to peat 

                         * * * 

late shadows gather in the dark

words unwrite
as they are written
unspeak
as they are spoken

songs sprung
from heart and lung
to tongue

unsung

                         * * *

drunk winds stumble over shuffling roofs
shake his sleep who dreams
a lost love
will not 
let 
go

recurring swirls
of old gold
blown light 

you can't help 
but be in it 

as it opens 
and falls back on itself
unfolds and unsays

I do not want to die
without writing the unwritten

pleasure of water

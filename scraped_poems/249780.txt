I have no illusion 
some fusion
               of force and form 
will save me, 
bewilderment
              of bonelight
 ungrave me

as when the El 
shooting through a hell
               of ratty alleys 
where nothing thrives 
but soot
              and the ratlike lives 
that have learned to eat it

screechingly peacocked 
a grace of sparks
              so far out and above
 the fast curve that jostled 
and fastened us
               into a single shock of—
I will not call it love

but at least some brief
and no doubt illusionary belief
               that in one surge of brain 
we were all seeing 
one thing:
                a lone unearned loveliness
struck from an iron pain.

Already it was gone. 
Already it was bone,
              the gray sky 
and the encroaching skyline
 pecked so clean
              by raptor night 
I shuddered at the cold gleam

we hurtled toward
like some insentient herd
                plunging underground at Clark 
and Division. 
And yet all that day
              I had a kind of vision 
that's never gone completely away

of immense clear-paned towers 
and endlessly expendable hours
               through which I walked 
teeming human streets, 
filled with a shine
              that was most intimately me
and not mine.

I. Of Choice 
Despair is big with friends I love,
Hydrogen and burning jews.
I give them all the grief I have
But I tell them, friends, I choose, I choose,

Don't make me say against my glands 
Or how the world has treated me. 
Though gay and modest give offense 
And people grieve pretentiously,

More than I hoped to do, I do 
And more than I deserve I get; 
What little I attend, I know
And it argues order more than not.

My desperate friends, I want to tell 
Them, you take too delicate offense
At the stench of time and man's own smell, 
It is only the smell of consequence.

II. Of Love 
People love each other and the light 
Of love gilds but doesn't alter,
People don't change one another, can scarcely
By taking will and thought add a little 
Now and then to their own statures 
Which, praise them, they do,
So that here we are in all our sizes
Flooded in the impartial daylight sometimes, 
Spotted sometimes in a light we make ourselves, 
Human, the beams of attention 
Of social animals at their work 
Which is loving; and sometimes all dark.

The only correction is
By you of you, by me of me.
People are worth looking at in this light 
And if you listen what they are saying is,
Love me sun out there whoever you are, 
Chasing me from bed in the morning, 
Spooking me all day with shadow, 
Surprising me whenever you fall;
Make me conspicuous as I go here,
Spotted by however many beams,
Now light, finally dark. I fear
There is meant to be a lot of darkness,

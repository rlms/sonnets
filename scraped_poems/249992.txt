Hand me this hand
The sail is bent
The trail is sold
and the wind tied in knots

Answer the phone
The tune is left
The stones uncoil
in a wide-angle lens

A search for clues
encounters bliss
A lip on the edge
of the flowering dark

A shell falls with hail
Hidden and hides
The following sky
The descending kiss.

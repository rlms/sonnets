In a famous painting of a founding father
and the back end of a horse

it's the horse butt that's properly lit
groomed out        smooth       an immortal peach

Who can say what it means about revolution
that the horse's tail emerges as though it had no bones in it

no chunky mechanics of the living
And the horse is not well muscled

but has been living in the rich grass
swollen like a birthday balloon

                "the shows here all fights are prepared by women"
evening at the bar below
only four ninety nine
that's cheap
as we walk to our room a hundred feet away
Id taken photo with a shirtless Pac
about to warm up for his battle with Bisping
anything goes
I say to Bisping "he will mishmash your face"
working behind Atul's lead & one other's
later inside room give Taija a huge hug
I think it must have been Arun's room
or
another minimalist orange variation book by Casey Anthony
feel or leave bleeding through margins
a French door to let cooling breeze certain sway
crystal night
I could swear more people Im familiar with & trust present
it has to be Mama whom I correspond with or new letter I read
cry out name of anyone close to me in their strangle house
whose owner Ive made my acquaintance 
name English evening in this outer sphere
when alone you feel the cloth down your back like the cosmos
always admire the poet or comics able to bring bone essence
unwrit till name language happen
get leaves behind in open living space
where owner by family wife with this book in orange flower
              "Beautiful!"

The Due D'Aumal's cannonballs
Are being marshmellowed 370 years from their masonic inception
Now lie on the Potomac
The Due D'Aumal's balls cannonaded
Split
Through mirror teeth Washington D.C.
Black City of white rectangular bits of fear
Blown fluff of fear
O the Duke of Aumal's balls are raging
Yellow vermin white houses of fear
And beautiful funky people
Diamond heart D'Afrique

When the end was near
He threatened   hands trembling
There is no end    never    his hands reaching to my face
You can't leave   taking off his shirt   going for his pants
The trickle of sweat beading off his nose

Moon-orb spray   metallic shimmer     slicklove
Tripping numb night shadows
Crows perched on a streetlight

We're terrestrial ants living in fragility
On Huhugam sacred ground
Jar of our dead

Like ragged cats my ghosts and I
Gossip in the alley behind a bar
My eyes grasp theirs     a spark     revolution
Feet without tracks on gravel

Our existence erased   far off
From clinking beer bottles and vanity

On the bench outside a bookstore
We get erased    see the news of the street
Resistance getting milled

My favorite ghosts and I bear down harder    birth ourselves

On the bench outside a bookstore
Frigid wind wants to snatch our secrets

Hey nay ya na ya na ya na
I thank you thank you for your presence
My ghosts   I thank you for your presence
Hey nay ya na   ya na   ya na  ya na
This dilemma  oh ancestors
O! ancestors !!!!   I thank you  thank you  thank you
Hey nay ya na ya na ya na ya na

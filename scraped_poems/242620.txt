Her hand is at the feedbag at her waist, 
sunk to the wrist in the rustling grain 
that nuzzles her fingertips when laced 
around a sifting handful. It's like rain, 
like cupping water in your hand, she thinks, 
the cracks between the fingers like a sieve, 
except that less escapes you through the chinks 
when handling grain. She likes to feel it give 
beneath her hand's slow plummet, and the smell, 
so rich a fragrance she has never quite
got used to it, under the seeming spell 
of the charm of the commonplace. The white 
hens bunch and strut, heads cocked, with tilted eyes, 
till her hand sweeps out and the small grain flies.

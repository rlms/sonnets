They're all dressed up in carmine 
floor-length velvet gowns, their upswirled hair 
festooned with matching ribbons: 
their fresh hopes and our fond hopes for them 
infuse this sort-of-music as if happiness could actually be 
each-plays-her-part-and-all-will-take-care-of-itself. 
Their hearts unscarred under quartz lights 
beam through the darkness in which we sit 
to show us why we endured at home 
the squeaking and squawking and botched notes 
that now in concert are almost beautiful, 
almost rendering this heartrending music 
composed for an archduke who loved it so much 
he spent his fortune for the musicians 
who could bring it brilliantly to life.

My earliest wish was not to exist,
to burst in the backyard 
without violence, 
no blood, no fleshy bits, 
mute button pressed
alone behind the rectory 
where no one would see me.

This wasn't a plea to be found 
or mourned for, but to be unborn 
into the atmosphere. To hang 
in the humid air, as ponds vent upward 
from the overheated earth,
rise until they freeze
and crystallize, then drop 
into the aquifer.

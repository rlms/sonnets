(1825)
1. CUVIER 
                               
               Science, science, science! 
               Everything is beautiful 

               blown up beneath my glass. 
               Colors dazzle insect wings. 

               A drop of water swirls 
               like marble. Ordinary 

               crumbs become stalactites 
               set in perfect angles 

               of geometry I'd thought 
               impossible. Few will 

               ever see what I see 
               through this microscope. 

               Cranial measurements 
               crowd my notebook pages, 

               and I am moving closer, 
               close to how these numbers 

               signify aspects of 
               national character. 

               Her genitalia 
               will float inside a labeled 

               pickling jar in the Musée 
               de l'Homme on a shelf 

               above Broca's brain: 
               “The Venus Hottentot.” 

               Elegant facts await me. 
               Small things in this world are mine. 

2. 

There is unexpected sun today 
in London, and the clouds that 
most days sift into this cage 
where I am working have dispersed. 
I am a black cutout against 
a captive blue sky, pivoting 
nude so the paying audience 
can view my naked buttocks. 

I am called “Venus Hottentot.” 
I left Capetown with a promise 
of revenue: half the profits 
and my passage home: A boon! 
Master's brother proposed the trip; 
the magistrate granted me leave. 
I would return to my family 
a duchess, with watered-silk 

dresses and money to grow food, 
rouge and powders in glass pots, 
silver scissors, a lorgnette, 
voile and tulle instead of flax, 
cerulean blue instead 
of indigo. My brother would 
devour sugar-studded non- 
pareils, pale taffy, damask plums. 

That was years ago. London's 
circuses are florid and filthy, 
swarming with cabbage-smelling 
citizens who stare and query, 
“Is it muscle? bone? or fat?” 
My neighbor to the left is 
The Sapient Pig, “The Only 
Scholar of His Race.” He plays 

at cards, tells time and fortunes 
by scraping his hooves. Behind 
me is Prince Kar-mi, who arches 
like a rubber tree and stares back 
at the crowd from under the crook 
of his knee. A professional 
animal trainer shouts my cues. 
There are singing mice here. 

“The Ball of Duchess DuBarry”: 
In the engraving I lurch 
toward the belles dames, mad-eyed, and 
they swoon. Men in capes and pince-nez 
shield them. Tassels dance at my hips. 
In this newspaper lithograph 
my buttocks are shown swollen 
and luminous as a planet. 

Monsieur Cuvier investigates 
between my legs, poking, prodding, 
sure of his hypothesis. 
I half expect him to pull silk 
scarves from inside me, paper poppies, 
then a rabbit! He complains 
at my scent and does not think 
I comprehend, but I speak 

English. I speak Dutch. I speak 
a little French as well, and 
languages Monsieur Cuvier 
will never know have names. 
Now I am bitter and now 
I am sick. I eat brown bread, 
drink rancid broth. I miss good sun, 
miss Mother's sadza. My stomach 

is frequently queasy from mutton 
chops, pale potatoes, blood sausage. 
I was certain that this would be 
better than farm life. I am 
the family entrepreneur! 
But there are hours in every day 
to conjur my imaginary 
daughters, in banana skirts 

and ostrich-feather fans. 
Since my own genitals are public 
I have made other parts private. 
In my silence I possess 
mouth, larynx, brain, in a single 
gesture. I rub my hair 
with lanolin, and pose in profile 
like a painted Nubian 

archer, imagining gold leaf 
woven through my hair, and diamonds. 
Observe the wordless Odalisque. 
I have not forgotten my Xhosa 
clicks. My flexible tongue 
and healthy mouth bewilder 
this man with his rotting teeth. 
If he were to let me rise up 

from this table, I'd spirit 
his knives and cut out his black heart, 
seal it with science fluid inside 
a bell jar, place it on a low 
shelf in a white man's museum 
so the whole world could see 
it was shriveled and hard, 
geometric, deformed, unnatural.

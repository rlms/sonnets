You don't need always to be scrubbing the tiles, Hendrickje, 
my eye drinks itself, 
drinks itself to death—
but other drink is in short supply—
the little Buddha there,
Chinese grove god
in exchange for a ladleful of Hulstkamp,
please!

Never painted anything 
in frost-white or ice-skater blue 
or that Irish green 
in which the purple shimmers through—
always my own monotone,
my compulsion to shadows—
not pleasant
to pursue that path so clearly.

Greatness—where?
I pick up the slate-pencil and certain things appear 
on paper or canvas
or whatever the heck else—
result: Buddha bronze hocked for booze—
but I draw the line at homage under ornamental plants,
banquet of the painters' guild—
something for the boardroom!

...Creaking, 
little sheep squeaking, chromotypes
Flemish, Rubensish—
for the grandchildren 
(same idiots!) 
Ah—Hulstkamp, 
hits the spot, 
midpoint of colors, 
my shadow brown, 
stubble aura around heart and eye—

Before the train screamed him through tunnels 
to his windowless office, the idiots
 he had to "sir," my father needed a space 
without us, so in a crack of light from the bathroom, 
he dressed, held his shoes by two fingers, 
and left us sleeping. That walk 

to the diner, the last stars fading out, 
the sky lightening from black to blue to white, 
was his time. He walked in all weather, 
let each season touch him all over, 
lifted his face to rain and sun. He liked 
to watch the old houses stir awake
 and nod to the woman in her slippers on 27th, 
smoking as she strolled her little mutt. 
To step back, smooth as Fred Astaire,
 from the paperboy's wild toss. 

Milk bottles sweated on doorsteps, 
sweet cream on top, and once, he lifted a quart 
from its wire basket, drank it down 
beneath our neighbor's winking porch light, 
and left the empty on the stoop.

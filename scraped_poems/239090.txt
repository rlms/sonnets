the templar 
halls of museums, for

example, or 
the chambers of churches, 

and admire 
no more than the beauty 

there, or 
remember the graveness

of stone, or 
whatever. You don't 

have to do any
better. You don't have to

understand 
the liturgy or know history 

to feel holy
in a gallery or presbytery. 

It is enough
to have come just so far. 

You need 
not be opened any more 

than does 
a door, standing ajar.

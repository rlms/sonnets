Since I was the one who had been ill, it was me she came to see.
Everyone wanted a glimpse of her.
The people emerged from their houses toward mine 
and with such caution. 
They made a visor of their hands.
It was as if they were to be accounted for,
wading the long uphill, little moving triangles 
all I could distinguish at first.
But the queen came to see only me and I saw her. 
And my life for a while was dismissed
and so repaired.

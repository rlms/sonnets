The border 
of a thing.

Its edge 
or hem.

The selvage, 
the skirt,

a perimeter's 
trim.

The blow 
of daylight's 

end and 
nighttime's 

beginning.
A fence 

or a rim, 
a margin, 

a fringe.
And this: 

the grim,
stingy 

doorstep
where 

the lapse 
of passage

happens.
That slim 

lip of land,
the liminal 

verge
that slips

you past
your brink.

Where 
and when

you 
blink.

(homage Jacob van Hoddis)
The CIA and the KGB exchange Christmas cards 
A blade snaps in two during an autopsy 
The bouquet Bluebeard gave his first date reblooms 
Many protest the public stoning of a guitar pick 

Railroad trains drop off the bourgeois' pointy head 
A martyr sticks a coffeecup out under a firehose 
Moviestars make hyenas lick their spaceship 
God's hand descends into a glove held steady by the police 

At their reunion The New Faces recognize each other 
A spoiled child sleeps inside a thermometer 
A single misprint in a survival manual kills everyone 
The peace night makes according to the world comes

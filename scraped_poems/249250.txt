I poured a whiskey and soda 
watching the tree outside dissolve: 
light going backward Â  pushed to corners 
to the white sliver of wood 
around the door.

Where was that river seething with light? 
I recall the banks menaced by wasps
swollen on summer sap, a cement hollow 
stuck with their strange cradles 
a woozy stench of damp clay 
the blunt poison of water snakes.

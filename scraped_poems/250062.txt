Do you know where our child has gone?
I'm sorry. Do you know what has become
of him? I'm sorry. [        .] Is he hiding
in a closet? No. Is he crouched among
the shoes? No. [        .] Should we look
in the closets? He's not in the closets. [        .]
Should we check the empty boxes? He's not
in the empty boxes.

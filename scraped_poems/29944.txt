Basilica of San Zeno Maggiore, Verona
A chubby fist and wing 
float free, severed 
from the landscape of human affairs. 

Below, a barefoot saint 
seems to straddle acres, beaming 
casual self-possession, the divine 

right to stake eternal claim—but 
in the space between 
both legs, a third intrudes, 

last remnant of a man fading 
to white dust. Nine hundred years ago 
this wall was his. Reduced 

to a toehold, he now spites 
the fourteenth-century arriviste, 
holding his ground with the ghost 

of what he was. The saint remains 
oblivious. Centuries sweep 
around him like planets' rings; 

the church's wheel-of-fortune 
spins rose light 
through plague and war. 

Yet so vivid 
are his blue and russet robes, 
he glistens—a refugee 

from a sun shower 
who's arrived dripping wet, an idea 
fresh from the brush of his maker.

The city is missing, and we've saved others, our backs turned. What happened is a different reality in everyone's mind, but the direction we took tells us the world doesn't end when we force air out of bones. Now we know the myth by the cup of coffee going cold, realize we were never told how to take the street parallel to our heart.

Quilt voice into flat prairie land.

Swell stature into argument.

Carve wrongdoing into wood chips, easily digestible.

Engage in preemptive fork removal.

Do not be implicit.

Silence, a coiled threat.

What's in your holster?

Separate the child from the chaff. I mean, spoon the cream off the top.

What do you mean you don't have a holster?

Keep the curds. Discard the whey.

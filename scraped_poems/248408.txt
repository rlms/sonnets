Some may have blamed you that you took away 
The verses that could move them on the day 
When, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind 
With lightning, you went from me, and I could find 
Nothing to make a song about but kings, 
Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things 
That were like memories of youâ€”but now 
We'll out, for the world lives as long ago; 
And while we're in our laughing, weeping fit, 
Hurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit. 
But, dear, cling close to me; since you were gone, 
My barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone.

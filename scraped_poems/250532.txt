my name is Alice Elizabeth, so am I
Allie Sheedy of the movie Short Circuits thus angry 
or Elizabeth McGovern self-controlled? 
This question is posited
on a television screen where I can't quite identify 
the actress shown—which is she?

I am Allie and I will continue to rant.

I'm still in the forest, darkening 
wishing I were 'nicer.'

Hardwood says, You should stand up soon 
I'll help you 
I say, I have cramps 
I say, I'm using my period, to get pissed off and to Know.

I dreamed, last night, about an immense Dead Seal 
below the surface of the water in a harbor

pull the curtain down.
For months you would not break the spell
for eternities you have not done so, citing economic 
exigencies; the whole thing is a mess.
I might rather be dead
than doing what it takes to keep the seal under water 
whale-sized

E is for seal. For spell. For suppression.

The dead seal isn't a person, it's poetry the seal
 the hallmark
of selfhood, dead grotesquely large and richly hardening.

"Hardwood it was someone like you 
you drowned the seal"

"No I'm making both you and it 'hard.' "

And I'm still in the forest

Money's more the real live poetry 
abstract symbolic imaginary 
trade your life for it and trade it for your life 
so you'll have something 'to do'

Sink the whale
and sleep all day in the real world, up and functioning
 more fully imagined and dreamed, in society's 
than in your own, imagination?

I'm standing
I'm standing up Hard
I keep being Hardwood myself, dark and hard.

 We're a very unpopular group today
We've shot off another great bomb

Tell me something beautiful, bitter

So I don't have to be cloyed.

... soul's waters are reticent
sly swamps.
                       It had nothing in it, 
that swamp; because I didn't know how to look for 
the parts of its obvious whole—death is 
minute, flavorful parts—which are said to spin 
as I'm said to walk, moving while else
mostly unconscious of that.

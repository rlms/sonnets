Let us not speak of those days 
when coffee beans filled the morning 
with hope, when our mothers' headscarves 
hung like white flags on washing lines. 
Let us not speak of the long arms of sky 
that used to cradle us at dusk. 
And the baobabs—let us not trace 
the shape of their leaves in our dreams, 
or yearn for the noise of those nameless birds 
that sang and died in the church's eaves. 
Let us not speak of men, 
stolen from their beds at night. 
Let us not say the word
                                            disappeared.

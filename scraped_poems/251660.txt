between basalt cliffs
no one mourns
the loss of statecraft.

a blaze over water
reminds a quayside
that soon the sea
shall round up stoneposts,
tapers and—

should the seafarer
invite tenderness to meander
through returning hairlines

should his fingers
          become racy
               or go idling through 
               wingtips of paranoia

—the sea shall watch itself
    riot
          and
reclaim the storm
       that
snaps and screams
       and 
whirls past clambacks
porcupine quills

seeds of clover
flesh of tides.

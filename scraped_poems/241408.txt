Until nightfall my son ran in the fields, 
looking for God knows what. 
Flowers, perhaps. Odd birds on the wing. 
Something to fill an empty spot.
Maybe a luminous angel 
or a country girl with a secret dark. 
He came back empty-handed, 
or so I thought.

Now I find them: 
thistles, goatheads, 
the barbed weeds 
all those with hooks or horns 
the snaggle-toothed, the grinning ones 
those wearing lantern jaws,
old ones in beards, leapers 
in silk leggings, the multiple 
pocked moons and spiny satellites, all those 
with juices and saps 
like the fingers of thieves 
nation after nation of grasses 
that dig in, that burrow, that hug winds 
and grab handholds 
in whatever lean place.

It's been a good day.

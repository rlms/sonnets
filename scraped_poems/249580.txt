A basket of apples brown in our kitchen, 
 their warm scent is the scent of ripening,

and my sister, entering the room quietly, 
 takes a seat at the table, takes up the task

of peeling slowly away the blemished skins, 
 even half-rotten ones are salvaged carefully.

She makes sure to carve out the mealy flesh. 
 For this, I am grateful. I explain, this elegy

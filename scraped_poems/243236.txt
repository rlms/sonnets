The fern in the rain breathes the silver message. 
Stay, lie low. Play your dark reeds 
and relearn the beauty of absorption. 
There is nothing beyond the rotten log
covered with leaves and needles. 
Forget the light emerging with its golden wick. 
Raise your face to the water-laden frond. 
A thousand blossoms will fall into your arms.

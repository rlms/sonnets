Old Woman Nature
naturally has a bag of bones
                tucked away somewhere.
                a whole room full of bones!

A scattering of hair and cartilage
               bits in the woods.

A fox scat with hair and a tooth in it. 
               a shellmound
                      a bone flake in a streambank.

A purring cat, crunching 
               the mouse head first,
                       eating on down toward the tail--
 
The sweet old woman
               calmly gathering firewood in the
               moon . . .

Don't be shocked,
She's heating you some soup.

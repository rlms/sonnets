Mama said 
it only existed in storybooks 

with its soft surface 
of  bluebells 

but there it was 
spinning so close to the earth 

that it bent
every weather vane in Omaha 

it was prom night

and I thought I'd pluck a few 
trumpets

to bring your Grandma 

so I pulled our red ladder out 
of  the garage 

and climbed to the roof 

I stood up 
and imagined I was balancing 

the moon on my head 

the narrow windows of  Union 
Station 

gleamed like ice chips 

and the thin faces of the clock 
tower told me 

it was almost eight 

I was going to be late picking 
Nancy up 

if  I didn't get a move on 

so I snipped off the best stems 
and hurried 

back down to my Ford 

I sped through every stop sign 
on my way 

to her parents' house 

she was waiting with her arms 
crossed 

trying not to look upset 

I think she thought 
she was going to get stood up 

so when I popped open 
the door 

and told her to get in 
she couldn't help smiling a bit 

she asked 
what'd taken me so long

and I figured I should go ahead 

and give her the flowers
I'd brought her 

I'd set them
back behind the steering wheel 

to not ruin the surprise 

I told her she was the princess 
and I was the knight

who rode into the stars

so he could flare 
their notes to her on a blue horn

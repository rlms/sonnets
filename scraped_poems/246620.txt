Every family that lived in our court 
had an American truck 
with a union sticker on the back

and as a kid I admired them 
the way I thought our soldiers 
must have admired Patton 
and Sherman tanks.

You once told me 
that the Russians couldn't take us, 
not with towns like ours 
full of iron, full of workers tempered 
by the fires of foundries and mills.

It wasn't the Russians that came; 
it was the contract, the strike, 
the rounds of layoffs that blistered 
until your number was called.

I still remember you loading up 
to leave for the last time, 
the union sticker scraped off 
with a putty knife,

the end of the white tarp draped 
over your truck bed 
flapping as you drove away.

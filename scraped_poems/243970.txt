A can of self-defense pepper spray says it may
 irritate the eyes, while a bathroom heater says it's
 not to be used in bathrooms. I collect warnings
 the way I used to collect philosophy quotes.
  
 Wittgenstein's There's no such thing
 as clear milk rubs shoulders with a box 
 of rat poison which has been found
 to cause cancer in laboratory mice.
  
 Levinas' Language is a battering ram—
 a sign that says the very fact of saying,
 is as inscrutable as the laser pointer's advice:
 Do not look into laser with remaining eye.
   
 Last week I boxed up the solemn row 
 of philosophy tomes and carted them down
 to the used bookstore. The dolly read:
 Not to be used to transport humans. 
  
 Did lawyers insist that the 13-inch wheel 
 on the wheelbarrow proclaim it's
 not intended for highway use? Or that 
 Curling iron is for external use only?
  
 Abram says that realists render material
 to give the reader the illusion of the ordinary. 
 What would he make of this injunction? Shin pads
 cannot protect any part of the body they do not cover. 
  
 I load boxes of books onto the counter. Flip
 to a yellow-highlighted passage in Aristotle: 
 Whiteness which lasts for a long time is no whiter
 than whiteness which lasts only a day. 
  
 A.A.ers talk about the blinding glare of the obvious: 
 Objects in the mirror are actually behind you.
 Electric cattle prod only to be used on animals.
 Warning: Knives are sharp. Thank you!
  
 What would I have done without: remove infant
 before folding for storage, Do not use hair dryer 
 while sleeping, Eating pet rocks may lead to broken teeth,
 Do not use deodorant intimately?
  
 Goodbye to all those books that sought to puncture
 the illusory world—not unlike the warning on the
 polyester Halloween outfit I bought for my son:
 Superman costume will not enable you to fly.

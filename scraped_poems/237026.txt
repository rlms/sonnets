At forty-eight, to be given water,
which is most of the world, given life
in water, which is most of me, given ease,

which is most of what I lack, here, where walls 
don't part to my hands, is to be born 
as of three weeks ago. Taking nothing 

from you, mother, or you, sky, or you, 
mountain, that you wouldn't take 
if offered by the sea, any sea, or river, 

any river, or the pool, beside which 
a woman sits who would save me 
if I needed saving, in a red suit, as if flame 

is the color of emergency, as I do, 
need saving, from solid things, 
most of all, their dissolve.

Raccoon you better be cool

Thought I saw you on Broadway
Eating King Fish's barbecue

Some people claim raccoon you pretty
Swear raccoon tame like a kitty 

But raccoon bites you if you get too close

I saw raccoon on Lenox Avenue
Stealing milk from a baby 

Thought I saw a black cat on the corner
But it was nothing but old raccoon

Raccoon let me school you 

Raccoon you know you too country
You better leave the city

Raccoon they got rats in New York City
Big as you and just as ornery 

Nobody in Harlem studying you raccoon
So you better go about your business

Raccoon you better get wise
Look what playing possum got the possum

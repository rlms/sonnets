is thought to be a confession, won by endless 
torture, but which our interrogators must 
hate to recordâ€”all those old code names, dates, 
the standard narrative of sandpaper 
throats, even its remorse, fall ignored. Far 

away, a late (not lost) messenger stares, 
struck by window bargains or is it the gift 
of a sudden solicitude: is she going to 
lift up her shadow's weight, shift hers 
onto it? She knows who bears whom. In 

that momentary museum where memory occurs 
more accrue of those torturers' pincers than 
lessened fingernails, eyes teased to a pulp, 
we beg for closeups. Ormolus, objets d'art!  
A satyr drains an hourglass with one gulp.

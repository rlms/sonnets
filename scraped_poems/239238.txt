Skipping out from the major international cocktail party
with my becleavaged blight, a jeroboam in her tight fist,
I broke open my copy of Sarcasm for Beginners, i.e., men.

Never had I seen so many pairs of to-the-elbow gloves.
Never did I see a puttoed ceiling groan so with thin talk
as the great, the grim and the gone pressed terrible flesh,

so many penguins offering tastesome wisps and skimps
from doilied salvers: cherry-shaded caviar, cheese puffs,
dark sugared berries, dainty octopods, gently vinegared,

with not enough tentacles to count the capes and stoles,
fine bespoke pashminas, silk snoods, at least one vicu√±a
suit, tainted with gold thread. I'd seen down a Blenheim,

two Lime Rickeys and was eyeing a gamine mixologist
who was straining out Savoy Royales when my raddled
nemesis limped over to announce she had encountered

my latest screed, all four foot eleven of her tortoiseishly
quivering, a nubbin of cream cheese on her whiskery lip
and her good eye withering my borrowed companionette

as she leaned on air. I am not a man who has not known
the turmoil women offer, the gift you accept of their wit,
the way you'd slip a hand into a gloveful of cockroaches,

comply with a last-minute call to join a seal cull. Tanya,
I pouted, I am awed and honored you opened a window
in your schedule even to glance at my inconsequential

outpourings. At which point she clattered out a scoffing
gibe so sour you couldn't blend it with a chemistry set
from Hamley's and, seizing my escort by her neat wrist,

we tore out onto Jermyn Street, along which I performed
a sort of shuffle, one eye on the book and one on m'lady's
competition-standard backside as she led us to the Ritz.

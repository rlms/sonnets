saw hammer drill
needle and tongs
are there any tools
that weren't from the beginning
misused for torture and killing

throw away the tools
even the nails on your fingers
can scratch
and about the tongue
the chinese have a saying,
it can pulverize a person

is there not some means that peace
can call its own

erect a house 
made of blossom petals
and bird down
capacious as a dream
and no one will live in it

all we have is 
what keeps its form
to hold something together
you must use force
even for peace

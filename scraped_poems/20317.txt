It smiles to see me 
Still in my bathrobe. 

It sits in my lap
 And will not let me rise. 

Now it is kissing my eyes. 
Arms enfold me, arms 

Pale with a thick down. 
It seems I am falling asleep 

To the sound of a story 
Being read me. 

This is the story. 
Weeks have passed 

Since first I lifted my hand 
To set it down.

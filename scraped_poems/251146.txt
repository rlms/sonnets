Here again
at the edge of what was,

             the river held back
by the stones it has carried,

the knife in your hand
brimming

                          rain. Inside this day
without beginning or end, it cannot

stand still inside you.

             One day I'll leave—not you
but all this—this hunger

that pushes each wave.

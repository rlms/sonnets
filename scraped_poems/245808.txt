There's a clever thing, stabs at her hand
on every corner now, revising the screed. 
Watch her huff at the tiny screens that send
her chimpish copy up the line, to speed
the raising of the giddy, pixelled hall: 
cornerless, mirror-tiled, the gorging sphere
a fast-receding shell enclosing all
we say or see, never to disappear,
bigger with each second, and the next,
its facets auto-replicant, until
the Record of  what was — each fingered text
and pic, the starry shards the hours distill —
impounds what is, slaves us in its spell,
sorting the diamonds in our dazzling cell.

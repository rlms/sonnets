What flickers
with some delicacy

of feeling,

some hesitancy—
and then persists.

                 •

What circles. What darts.

                 •

Hunger

is like the inside
biting you.

“Like” is like
insomnia.

                •

These green cherry tomatoes;
their false pregnancies,

staked. Lustrous.

               •

“That's all I meant.”

All I meant by 
“witches.”

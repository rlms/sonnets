She has painted her lips 
hibiscus pink. 
The upper lip dips 
perfectly in the center 

like a Valentine heart. 
It makes sense to me— 
that the lips, the open 

ah of the mouth
 is shaped more like a heart 
than the actual human heart.
 I remember the first time I saw it— 

veined and shiny 
as the ooze of a snail— 
if this were what 
we had been taught to draw 

how differently we might have
learned to love.

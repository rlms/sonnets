How well its square
fit my palm, my mouth, 
a toasty wafer slipped 
onto the sick tongue
or into chicken soup,

each crisp saltine a tile 
pierced with 13 holes 
in rows of 3 and 2,
its edges perforated 
like a postage stamp,

one of a shifting stack 
sealed in wax paper 
whose noisy opening 
always signaled snack,Â 
peanut butter or cheese

thick inside Premiums,
the closest we ever got
to serving hors d'oeuvres:
the redneck's hardtack, 
the cracker's cracker.

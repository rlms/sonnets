Retired from other trades, they wore 
Work clothes again to mop the johns 
And feed the furnace loads of coal. 
Their roughened faces matched the bronze 

Of the school bell the nun would swing 
To start the day. They limped but smiled, 
Explored the secret, oldest nooks: 
The steeple's clock, dark attics piled 

With inkwell desks, the caves beneath 
The stage on Bingo night. The pastor 
Bowed to the powers in their hands: 
Fuses and fire alarms, the plaster 

Smoothing a flaking wall, the keys 
To countless locks. They fixed the lights 
In the crawl space above the nave 
And tolled the bells for funeral rites. 

Maintain what dead men made. Time blurs 
Their scripted names and well-waxed floors, 
Those keepers winking through the years 
And whistling down the corridors.

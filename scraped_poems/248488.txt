And have we done with War at last?


Well, we've been lucky devils both,


And there's no need of pledge or oath


To bind our lovely friendship fast,


By firmer stuff


Close bound enough.
 


By wire and wood and stake we're bound,


By Fricourt and by Festubert,


By whipping rain, by the sun's glare,


By all the misery and loud sound,


By a Spring day,


By Picard clay.
 


Show me the two so closely bound


As we, by the wet bond of blood,


By friendship blossoming from mud,


By Death: we faced him, and we found


Beauty in Death,


In dead men, breath.

Lobster in the bathtub. Christmas Eve.
Scrub the tub first. Hand off cleanser.
Rinse well. We don't want Comet
in our lobster. 
He's clicking
against the porcelain. Everyone leery
              of going to the bathroom.

Bubbles had risen when we lowered him in,
now he's limp. 
Stare into the water
that wears a similar gooseflesh.
The lobster is dispatched.

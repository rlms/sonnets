Why speak of hate, when I do bleed for love?
 Not hate, my love, but Love doth bite my tongue
 Till I taste stuff that makes my rhyming rough
 So flatter I my fever for the one
 For whom I inly mourn, though seem to shun.
 A rose is arrows is eros, so what
 If I confuse the shade that I've become
 With winedark substance in a lover's cup?
 But stop my tonguely wound, I've bled enough.
 If I be fair, or false, or freaked with fear
 If I my tongue in lockèd box immure
 Blame not me, for I am sick with love.
      Yet would I be your friend most willingly
      Since friendship would infect me killingly.

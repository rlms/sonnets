Gray whale 
Now that we are sending you to The End 
That great god 
Tell him 
That we who follow you invented forgiveness 
And forgive nothing 

I write as though you could understand 
And I could say it 
One must always pretend something 
Among the dying 
When you have left the seas nodding on their stalks 
Empty of you 
Tell him that we were made 
On another day 
The bewilderment will diminish like an echo 

Winding along your inner mountains 
Unheard by us 
And find its way out 
Leaving behind it the future 
Dead 
And ours 

When you will not see again 
The whale calves trying the light 
Consider what you will find in the black garden 
And its court 
The sea cows the Great Auks the gorillas 
The irreplaceable hosts ranged countless 
And foreordaining as stars 
Our sacrifices 

Join your word to theirs 
Tell him 
That it is we who are important

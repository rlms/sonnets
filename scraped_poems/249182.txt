The courage to let go of the door, the handle. 
The courage to shed the familiar walls whose very 
stains and leaks are comfortable as the little moles 
of the upper arm; stains that recall a feast, 
a child's naughtiness, a loud blattering storm 
that slapped the roof hard, pouring through.

The courage to abandon the graves dug into the hill, 
the small bones of children and the brittle bones 
of the old whose marrow hunger had stolen; 
the courage to desert the tree planted and only 
begun to bear; the riverside where promises were 
shaped; the street where their empty pots were broken.

The courage to leave the place whose language you learned 
as early as your own, whose customs however dan-
gerous or demeaning, bind you like a halter 
you have learned to pull inside, to move your load; 
the land fertile with the blood spilled on it; 
the roads mapped and annotated for survival.

The courage to walk out of the pain that is known 
into the pain that cannot be imagined, 
mapless, walking into the wilderness, going 
barefoot with a canteen into the desert; 
stuffed in the stinking hold of a rotting ship 
sailing off the map into dragons' mouths,

Oh father, oh music man 
with a whistle instead of a coin 
to toss on your walks, 
keep these things for us 
until we're ready to come home:

our baby teeth, fragments of bone 
that rattle in a domino box. 
Tuck it in your pocket but please 
don't gamble it away 
the way you lost our

christening gowns in poker. 
We had outgrown them, true, 
but what other proof 
did we have that all seven 
of our outfits could be stacked

and shuffled like a deck
of cards. Keep the bottle cap
opener hanging by a string.
Wear it like a locket
and stay collared to our after-school

bliss when we found you 
underneath a tree that scattered 
glass fruit around your feet. 
The boys lined them up 
for death by slingshot,

and the girls giggled 
when the bodies shattered. 
Take good care of our drawings, 
our crooked handwriting
 exercises, the scribbles of our names,

and sew a suit with sailboats 
on the sleeves, a coat with Qs 
sliding down a wire, and pants 
that celebrate our prepubescent
 autographs. And in your shoe—

don't tell us which! let us guess!— 
save the coin you told us 
came from China. It had a hole 
in the middle because the merchants 
slid their change on chopsticks.

We pictured them on market 
Sundays holding up their earnings 
like a shish kabob. We know 
you hid the coin because all seven 
of us wanted it and so you

took it with you. Or so I claimed. 
Can I be blamed, oh father, oh story 
man, for wanting to possess 
the single thing that couldn't be shared? 
You saw me slide it out

the window of your wallet 
while you napped and didn't 
snap to attention to complain. 
Of all your sons and daughters 
it is I who wanted to escape the most,

to anywhere. I learned the desperate 
alchemy of flowering a barren day 
with song from you, oh master. 
A minstrel needs his freedom. 
And so you let me take it.

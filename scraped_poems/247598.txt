With razorblade eyes                       The Filipina is most sincere
With too much water                      And will make a very good wife.

With animal teeth                            The Filipina is a loyal partner,
We sometimes kill                            Deserving of all your love.

With splintered hands                    The Filipina is the total package,
With too much life                           Much more than meets the eye.

With ribcage unlocked                   The Filipina is not for you,
We wither your roots                     If  you cannot handle her claws.

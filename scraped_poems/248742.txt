After Robert Hooke
All afternoon a reddish trickle
out of the roots of the beech


and across the lawn,

a sort ofâ€Š rust that shines and dances.
Close up, it proves to be ant,


each droplet a horned

traveler finicking its way round
the crooked geometry


of a grass forest.

A finger felled in their path rocks them,
amazed, back on their haunches.


I see them tasting

the air for subtle intelligence,
till one ventures to scale it,


and others follow.


They are fidgety subjects to draw.
If you sink the feet in glue


the rest twists and writhes;

kill one, the juices evaporate
in seconds, leaving only


the shriveled casing.

I dunked one in brandy. It struggled
till the air rose from its mouth


in pinprick bubbles.

I let it soak an hour, then dried it,
observed the spherical head,


the hairlike feelers,

the grinning vice of its sideways jaw,
the coppery armor plate


with its scattered spines.


Some draft stirred it then. It rose to all
its feet, and set off across


the rough miles of desk.

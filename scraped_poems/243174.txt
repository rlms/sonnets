Some nothing afternoon, no one anywhere, 
an early autumn stillness in the air, 
the kind of empty day you fill by taking in 
the full size of the valley and its layers leading 
slowly to the Blue Ridge, the quality of country, 
if you stand here long enough, you could stay 
for, step into, the way a landscape, even on a wall, 
pulls you in, one field at a time, pasture and fall 
meadow, high above the harvest, perfect
to the tree line, then spirit clouds and intermittent 
sunlit smoky rain riding the tops of the mountains, 
though you could walk until it's dark and not reach those rainsâ€” 
you could walk the rest of the day into the picture 
and not know why, at any given moment, you're there.

Every half century, the synchronous flowering of bamboo causes famine in parts of India.
May we blossom every fifty years
without afflicting the people.

May our seedpods nourish rodents
who roam our groves

without rebuking lands with famine.
May sweet potatoes and rice save us.

May ginger and turmeric flourish
to the bitter distaste of rats

while tresses of bamboo flowers 
changeling white wasps

load the groves with seed
in rare perennial synchrony.  

May our sisters flower en masse
hundreds of square miles apart   

in the pale night. May our shoots  
pray a silent vision of healing,  

our rhizome-laden memories:
Yes, we share our hunger

only once on this earth, my love.
Let us bless our fruit and multiply.

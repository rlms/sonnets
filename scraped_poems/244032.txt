Your pansies died again today. 
All June I've watched them scorch and fall 
by noon, their faces folding down 
to tissue-paper triangles. 
I bring them back with water, words, 
a pinch, but they are sick to death 
of resurrection. You planted them 
last fall, these “Chillers” guaranteed 
to come again in spring. They returned 
in April—you did not. You who said 
pick all you want, it just makes more! 
one day in 1963, 
and I, a daughter raised on love 
and miracles, believed it.

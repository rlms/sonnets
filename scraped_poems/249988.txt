Que será, el café of this holy, incorporated place, 
the wild steam of scorched espresso cakes rising 
like mirages from the aromatic waste, waving 
over the coffee-glossed lips of these faces

assembled for a standing breakfast of nostalgia, 
of tastes that swirl with the delicacy of memories 
in these forty-cent cups of brown sugar histories, 
in the swirling froth of café-con-leche, que será,

what have they seen that they cannot forget—
 the broad-leaf waves of tabaco and plantains 
the clay dust of red and nameless mountains, 
que será, that this morning I too am a speck;

I am the brilliant guitar of a tropical morning 
speaking Spanish and ribboning through potions 
of waist-high steam and green cane oceans, 
que será, drums vanishing and returning,

the African gods that rule a rhythmic land 
playing their music: bongó, bembé, conga; 
que será, that cast the spells of this rumba, 
this wild birthright, this tropical dance

with the palms of this exotic confusion; 
que será, that I too should be a question, 
que será, what have I seen, what do I know— 
culture of café and loss, this place I call home.

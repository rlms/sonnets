For you can travel with a screaming red rolling bag 
and float unnoticed on conveyors, through terminals 

or you can lug half a moose rack from Maine 
to Minnesota, carry it like a broken wing through airports 

as my friend Gro did, and draw only the curious touches 
of children waiting at gates. But dare to travel with a guitar

 and invite confessions from strangers in pinstripe suits 
of garage band summers, invite winks, gotcha smiles, 

and devil's horns rock on gestures. Invite finger points 
and winks, the long tongue licks, and the rubberneck glance 

to check if you are someone famous. To dare to travel 
with a guitar is to mark yourself charismatic megafauna 

of the airport terminal. Old friend, what else could I do
 but carry you? I have stored you in closets, propped you 

in corners, hunched over you late-nights, staring perplexed 
at the mysteries of your neck. Body of my body, string 

of my strings, see how the world began to hum and sing
 that day at thirteen when I opened the big birthday box.

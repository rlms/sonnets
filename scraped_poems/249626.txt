My objectives this morning were vague. 
As always I'd hike these hills— 
a way to keep going 
against the odds age deals, 
a way to keep body and soul
 together, and not so much thinking 
as letting things steal into mind— 
but I started counting 

from the very first step I took. 
I wore rank old boots, ill-laced, 
and patchwork pants. 
Around my neck hung the frayed 
lanyard of a whistle I use
 to summon our trio of dogs, 
who capered and yelped their pleasure 
at one of our walks, 

and more miraculous still, 
at having me for a master. 
It's true in a sense
 that I always count as I wander, 
though it's usually the beats of a tune 
(Thelonious's "Blue Monk" 
a favorite) that mark my time. 
These counts felt odder, 

better. We scattered a brood 
of grouse at step 91. 
The deerflies strafed us. 
At 500 a late trillium 
glowed by a ledge like a lotus. 
Right along the rain kept pounding. 
I was mindful of all these things 
but I never stopped counting. 

Life was good, and more. 
It was worthy of better response.
 At 1000 I thought,
 Enough—and counted on. 
Nothing was coming to mind. 
Nothing is coming again
 from my hike half the day ago 
with three dogs through rain 

but a mystic sense of well-being
 in quietly chanted numbers.
 Whatever this trance, 
I treasured it as a wonder 
not to be wrenched into meaning, 
as in Every second counts, 
as in You should count your blessings, 
though of those there seems no doubt.

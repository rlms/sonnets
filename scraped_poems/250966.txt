To thwart? To abet? To mete?
Quixotic cobbler, spread apocryphal

mendacity from Styx to Mt. Dix.
Yoke check to bank, broadcast

flaccid gospel. Raze it! Scorch it!
It's summertime in Mendocino.

Ah, poke stigmatized feet-stank.
Quotidian Stygian, pack funk-stuffed

rucksacks into boats of dope(d) diction.
Fuck Friday. Yes, you, Freya. Be fazed.

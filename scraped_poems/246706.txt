The asking was askance.
And the tell all told. 
So then, in tandem,

Anathema, and anthem.
The truth was on hold,
Seeking too tasking.

And the wool was pulled
Over as cover.
No eyes were kept peeled.

My iris I missed
The truth, now mistrust
All things seen, and this

Distrust, the sounded distress signal
Called and called and culled from your damsel.

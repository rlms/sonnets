These grapes of stone were being proffered, friend.
— John Berryman
grapes, rough-touched and round, stone-
carved, to be squeezed into the fundaments
of rock wine. She imagines it would be cold,
not sought for its smoothness,
and likely full of grit
if not refined with care.

The satyr laughs carelessly
for one caught in stone.
The cracked edges of his mouth spill grit
as he leers after the loss of his fundaments
which fall along the smooth,
cold

torso plane, exhibiting immaculate coolness
at this literal loss of face. Carefully,
she strokes his head, as if smoothing
the fetlocks handcrafted from stone.
Her affection is unforced, a fundamental
attraction to those beautiful, gritty

things made lovely by decay, their gritted
teeth so much more interesting than the art gallery's cold
geometrics, which appear fundamental
but fail to consider the careless
chaos spinning at the stone
center of all smooth

creations. And those grapes! Their unsmooth 
surface mirrors the messy passion flushing the grit-
dusted cheek, the hideous mouth of crumbling stone.
What heat from the Dionysian's cold,
brittle fruit! The obliteration of all care
if she could only perform the fundamental

act of eating. She thinks about wilderness, fun, mental
liberation, dancing her soles smooth,
pleasure as pervasive as care
is now, her feet a frenzied blur on the gritty
forest floor, shaking and pummeling out the cold
as she prances over starlit stones.

She does not care who sees her, as she grips the stone
grapes, feels the smooth, crumbling cold
enter her hand, fingers embracing a thing more fundamental than earth, bone, grit.

ghosts of America roam
land of fast food
                                       joints defined by movement

herds of taxi cabs apartments too expensive to rent

trained hands typing digital lives

                                                          commotion rust-shriek & blur of subway trains

                            O New York!       until my legs detect a din i walk

(signs call me back)

                                    shoes snivel   eyes a pocket
     
    wrinkled youth palsied
                                           elephantine ankles   cross-eyed ditty

a tic in the face is a chronicle of past grievings
                                                                              a cancerous cell love uncaved 
i write into this handbook of daytime things   tantrums   & baby paraphernalia


            claiming words which gather time

answering life   i sit & stare into cracks     stars of fate 
i visit you
across the sea of
                      disease between us
                                                                                                         let us be stricken 
                                                                                                         with poems

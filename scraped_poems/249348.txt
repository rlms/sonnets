We, the naturally hopeful,
Need a simple sign
 For the myriad ways we're capsized.
 We who love precise language
 Need a finer way to convey
 Disappointment and perplexity.
 For speechlessness and all its inflections,
 For up-ended expectations,
 For every time we're ambushed
 By trivial or stupefying irony,
 For pure incredulity, we need
 The inverted exclamation point.
 For the dropped smile, the limp handshake,
 For whoever has just unwrapped a dumb gift
 Or taken the first sip of a flat beer,
 Or felt love or pond ice
 Give way underfoot, we deserve it.
 We need it for the air pocket, the scratch shot,
 The child whose ball doesn't bounce back,
 The flat tire at journey's outset,
 The odyssey that ends up in Weehawken.
 But mainly because I need it – here and now
 As I sit outside the Caffe Reggio
 Staring at my espresso and cannoli
 After this middle-aged couple
 Came strolling by and he suddenly
 Veered and sneezed all over my table
 And she said to him, “See, that's why
 I don't like to eat outside.”

Your job—she gives another to the child
hip-high—is to heat the money in your hands
to the optimum warmth for purchase. Cagey,
the diversion in the same coin as his want.
It buys her time, enough that once
they round the corner, she might break into a sprint,
as one might with a pet who can keep up. But
the prophet makes eyes in his open fists
of the nickels' glint, and we see he forbears
our guess her hector gets lost in the flash

when as if by swale we all give way to expel 
a customer from the clench of us without her. 
For what beneath the moths who have all night
 to live do we brace ourselves as we approach? 
We lean to find again the boy's outguess of us.

Demand is double at the walk-up window, where 
punishment for paltry want is to tell it again 
into plexiglass the color of slobber, so others 
in the bleach of halogen light may deal 
their disparagement forward. For what if not 
dishonor are we braced, rehearsing what to ask? 
Repetition is a machine, a machine 
for converting request into appeal; and 
commerce, then, the window's byproduct or 
balm, depending. Red hot cashews, yellow bag.

Only because we visit by day do we know
at night what to call at the walk-up window
where two aisles of open merchandise end at
the sacral plates of clerks before us who, if
on pulleys they were carts instead or vending claws,
would be by now concussed and dented by
lever malevolence outright.
                                                    The prophet stands eye level 
with the vending plunge, a here and now mechanism 
he would need to invent to operate, and stands 
between it and his mother. Yellow bag.


                              Because there is not enough money in the world, people steal;...                                                           because there is not enough recognition, they make art

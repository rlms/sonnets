to mama who on the eve of my birth beat a bitch with a kool-aid spoon 
 for taking her eldest child's red balloon (if i wasn't wet-fisted, all hemmed 
 up inside cecelia, i'da jumped in)

 to the bazaar of milk & afterbirth that once was her body, piping hot
 almond dark with laughter & memories of fenced-in two-stepping 
 late night in a brownsville park

 to mama's hands, mad stallions pummeling dough for biscuits, cherry-scented
 butter-smeared fists or floured moons 

 to ms cloritha, professional crier for dilroy's funeral parlor (stuffed the 
 dead fulla who knows, once saw some geezer's toupee slid back like a 
 yarmulke, a woman's wig bangs in her ear, mourners too busy kiki-ing 
 in the back to tell the woman's kin her fall fell forward & dipped to the side 
 cloritha wailing all the while, earning her fifty bucks off the books) 

 to ms sheronda who daily bugged mama for dried black-eyed peas, swore 
 her son looked like a jackson (the eldest sissy, what's her face, bee bee, cee cee
 you know, “centipede”) 

 to the hungry black power thief who snatched nefertiti off our wall, public 
 enemy off the turntable, platter of mustard glazed tongue picked clean 
 in the kitchen sink

 to cuban ruben cross the hall who loved tongue & chuck D, father 
 figure by george michael (also gone from the crates), who OD'd 
 at the tunnel (stuntin') in mama's leopard print dress

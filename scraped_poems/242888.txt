Then there was the time I looked directly into the face 
of the life I thought I was missing, 

of love. I used to think to be not alone meant 
never having to walk through the high wheat 

or struggle in the water. Not having to decide not
to fling from some height.

Once, the two of us rode one bicycle.
I wore a straw hat and perched on the handlebars 

and beside us the sea oats swayed like skirts 
and I heard a trilling in the crabgrass. 

The sidewalks were bleached as Grecian stone
as we rode past the fish shop smelling of morningâ€”
salt, bread, limes, men.

Riding in front, it was such that 
I could not be heard always, at least not the first time

for you pedaled into the wind 
and my hair was a ribbon in your eyes.

I said I thought bougainvillea was a stoic plant 
and then had to say twice, no, stoic! and then 
no, the bougainvillea! and then you said easily 

it was nothing like that at all. 

But our future was clear enough when I asked if you saw 
the clean aprons of those men 

(how much longer you think until they clean the fish? 
did you see how white those aprons were? did you see?)

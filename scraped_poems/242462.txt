I look in the turned sod 
for an iron bolt that fell 
from the plow frame 
and find instead an arrowhead 
with delicate, chipped edges, 
still sharp, not much larger 
than a woman's long fingernail. 
Pleased, I put the arrowhead 
into my overalls pocket, 
knowing that the man who shot 
the arrow and lost his work 
must have looked for it
much longer than I will 
look for that bolt.

By the river years ago, recursive in memory, a 
finite moment, the past ended. Future began.

The river flowed south. You were a man's face
 floating among stones.

By a river in autumn, willow leaves were yellow 
whisks in updrafts. We were not alone.

Cottonwood boles twisted against banks, turtles 
dozed in the roots, bark slivered into water.

The river sounded the swish of its name. You 
waded the Neosho as it meandered east.

Two sandhill cranes fly overhead. Their legs 
stretch straight behind as they swim through air. 
Their grace is the river's.

No one saw flood-seined silt, gravel, broken 
mussel pearls. I stayed, you left.

By the river I met you each day. I meet you each 
day. I will be meeting you in invariant futures.

By the river leaves turn. Mud cracks pentagonal 
shapes. You return and leave. The river remains.

By the river I was a child, I am grown. I remember 
water pooled, not moving.

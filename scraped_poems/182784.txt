Sylvia Plath is setting my hair 
on rollers made from orange-juice cans. 
The hairdo is shaped like a pyre. 

My locks are improbably long. 
A pyramid of lemons somehow 
balances on the rickety table    

where we sit, in the rented kitchen 
which smells of singed naps and bergamot. 
Sylvia Plath is surprisingly adept 

at rolling my unruly hair. 
She knows to pull it tight. 
                                              Few words. 
Her flat, American belly, 

her breasts in a twin sweater set, 
stack of typed poems on her desk, 
envelopes stamped to go by the door, 

a freshly baked poppyseed cake, 
kitchen safety matches, black-eyed Susans 
in a cobalt jelly jar. She speaks a word, 

“immolate,” then a single sentence 
of prophecy. The hairdo done, 
the nursery tidy, the floor swept clean 

of burnt hair and bumblebee husks.

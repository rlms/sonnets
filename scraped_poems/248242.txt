How much delight before we collapse
How much earth in the lungs
How much wine

When we want more
When the weeds sprawl
It is not what you think

Think how fast some landscapes change
the lover, the gardener's grand idea,
the failing Maple

the boat about to capsize
the correction
the hand's reflection

the impossibile replication of weight
versus time
how it will never mean what you want

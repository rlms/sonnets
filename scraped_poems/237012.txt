You've planted and weeded and wheelbarrowed, 
           now tapping a pencil, trying to remember
the next thing—what was it?—when a shape 
           drops from the sky, shudders and stops
at a tree—red blotch—whack, whack. 
           A creature big enough on this slow spring day 
to make you mutter,

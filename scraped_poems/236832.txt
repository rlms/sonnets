For Audrey Richardson Curdy (1931–1986)
It was 1986, when currencies to be changed
          Into multiple-launch-surface, anti-tank missiles 
Swarmed through numbered bank accounts
          Like Ovid's seething knotted seed of frog-slime,
Which not seldome attracted by the sun falls 
          In little frogs with the rain; when it also rained  
Radionuclides, strontium, caesium,

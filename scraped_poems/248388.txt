God said, “Men have forgotten Me:
The souls that sleep shall wake again,
     And blinded eyes must learn to see.”

So since redemption comes through pain
He smote the earth with chastening rod,
   And brought destruction's lurid reign;

But where His desolation trod
The people in their agony
    Despairing cried, “There is no God.”

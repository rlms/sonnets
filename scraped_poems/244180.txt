Startled from snow-day slumber by a neighbor's mutt, 
it banged its buzzard's head then couldn't solve 
the problem of the white pine's limbs 
with wings nearly too broad for a planned descent. 
Somewhere an awkward angel knows 
whether it was dead before it hit the ground.
Any sinner could tell it was dead after—
eyes unseen beneath bare and wrinkled lids,
feet drawn up almost as high as hands.
I loved to watch thistle and millet 
disappear beneath it in the yard.
As snow covers feathers that will still be 
iridescent in the spring I remember seeing 
a businessman take a dripping handful 
of pocket change and throw it down 
a subway grate beside a homeless man. 
The coins bounced and clattered, vanishing 
in the humid dark. The rich man said 
now you're having a shitty day too. 
But it's not a shitty day and won't be 
when I retrieve the bird and walk it—
toes curling stiff from a shopping bag—
to a houseless scrap of oak savannah 
birdseed drew it from and dig it 
into deeper snow so what was hoarded 
by a man may by the thaw be doled.

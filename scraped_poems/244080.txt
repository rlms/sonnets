In the barn demoted to garage,
the ax in a cherry stump can't be budged.

Daylight perforates siding despite
the battered armor of license plates—

corroded colors, same state: decay,
their dates the only history 

of whoever tilled the soil 
and left, as a welcome, the skull 

of a possum nailed to the door, and the trail
of lime to the torn sack  

in a corner where cobwebs festoon a scythe.
Rusted sharp, it sings 

when he grips its splintery handle, swings, 
and crowns topple from Queen Anne's lace.

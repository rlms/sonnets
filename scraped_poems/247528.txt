—at Dubai International Airport and ending with a line by César Vallejo
Because I must walk
            through the eye-shaped 
shadows cast by these
            curved gold leaves thick 
atop each constructed
            palm tree, past displays 
of silk scarves, lit
            silhouettes of blue-bottled 
perfume—because
            I grip, as though for the first 
time, a paper bag
            of french fries from McDonald's, 
and lick, from each fingertip,
            the fat and salt as I stand alone
to the side of this moving
            walkway gliding me past dark-
eyed men who do not look
            away when I stare squarely 
back—because standing
            in line to the restroom I want 
only to pluck from her
            black sweater this one shimmering 
blond hair clinging fast—
            because I must rest the Coke, cold 
in my hand, beside this
            toilet seat warmed by her thighs, 
her thighs, and hers.
            Here, at the narrow mouth 
of this long, humid
            corridor leading to the plane, 
I take my place among
            this damp, dark horde of men 
and women who look like me—
            because I look like them— 
because I am ashamed
            of their bodies that reek so 
unabashedly of body—
            because I can—because I am 
an American, a star

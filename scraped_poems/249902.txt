The first to arrive when the sleepy-eyed coach 
   grunts good morning and undoes the rusty lock, 
       he starts each day facing the water alone—

the shimmering skin over the cold deep end 
    holding the calm of sunrise before his mind 
       bellows start. He plunges in to tame the water

before the water tames him back—cutting meat 
   and treading at the Y each weekend only keeping 
       the pounds in place. On the deck stool with

his fake leg stretched before him, the coach rasps 
   his creeds from the Navy. There's standing tough 
       and moving tough, he tells them. Whichever one's

tougher, that's what you do. On the cold mornings, 
    the slowest tries standing tough, his feet buckled 
        in at the water's edge and every still joint its own

heady fix. When he moves, he moves to reach 
   the finish line. The team is mired in last, not quailing 
       from the season's end the only victory left. All around,

hungry, he eyes the greater meets: the varsity team
   that shreds the water twice as fast, the seniors' cars 
       and flaunted car keys. Is every test decided

by the one before? Do the mind, the joints ever forget? 
    He stares down the water, his body cold and primed 
       for the tournament, finals, anything assigned.

Dad would come home after too long at work 
and I'd sit on his lap to hear 
the story of Ferdinand the Bull; every night, 
me handing him the red book until I knew 
every word, couldn't read,
just recite along with drawings 
of a gentle bull, frustrated matadors, 
the all-important bee, and flowers— 
flowers in meadows and flowers 
thrown by the Spanish ladies. 
Its lesson, really, 
about not being what you're born into 
but what you're born to be, 
even if that means 
not caring about the capes they wave in your face 
or the spears they cut into your shoulders. 
And Dad, wonderful Dad, came home 
after too long at work 
and read to me 
the same story every night 
until I knew every word, couldn't read,
                                                                              just recite.

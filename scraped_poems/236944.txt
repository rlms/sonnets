   for Alvester James
Long after it was
necessary, Uncle
Vess ate the leavings
off the hog, doused
them with vinegar sauce.
He ate chewy abominations.
Then came high pressure.
Then came the little pills.
Then came the doctor
who stole Vess's second
sight, the predication
of pig's blood every 
fourth Sunday.
Then came the stillness
of barn earth, no more 
trembling at his step.
Then came the end
of the rib, but before 
his eyes clouded,
Uncle Vess wrote
down the gospel
of barbecue.

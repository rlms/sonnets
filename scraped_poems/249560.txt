My mother likes a man who works. She likes 
my husband's muddy knees, grass stains on the cuffs. 
She loved my father, though when weekends came 
he'd sleep till nine and would not lift 
his eyes up from the page to move the feet
 she'd vacuum under. On Saturdays my husband 
digs the holes for her new roses, 
softening the clay with peat and compost. 
He changes bulbs she can no longer reach 
and understands the inside of her toaster. 
My father's feet would carry him from chair
 to bookshelf, back again till Monday came.
 My mother likes to tell my husband 
sit down in this chair and put your feet up.

Roast beef on whole wheat, please,
 With lettuce, mayonnaise and a center slice
 Of beefsteak tomato.
 The lettuce splayed, if you will,
 In a Beaux Arts derivative of classical acanthus,
 And the roast beef, thinly sliced, folded
 In a multi-foil arrangement
 That eschews Bragdonian pretensions
 Or any idea of divine geometric projection
 For that matter, but simply provides
 A setting for the tomato 
 To form a medallion with a dab
 Of mayonnaise as a fleuron.
 And—as eclectic as this may sound—
 If the mayonnaise can also be applied
 Along the crust in a Vitruvian scroll
 And as a festoon below the medallion,
 That would be swell.

You mean like in the Cathedral St. Pierre in Geneva?

Yes, but the swag more like the one below the rosette 
 At the Royal Palace in Amsterdam.

You got it.
 Next!

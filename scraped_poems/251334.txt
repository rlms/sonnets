I will tell you what he told me
 in the years just after the war
 as we then called
 the second world war
  
 don't lose your arrogance yet he said
 you can do that when you're older
 lose it too soon and you may
 merely replace it with vanity
  
 just one time he suggested
 changing the usual order
 of the same words in a line of verse
 why point out a thing twice
  
 he suggested I pray to the Muse
 get down on my knees and pray
 right there in the corner and he
 said he meant it literally
  
 it was in the days before the beard
 and the drink but he was deep
 in tides of his own through which he sailed
 chin sideways and head tilted like a tacking sloop
  
 he was far older than the dates allowed for
 much older than I was he was in his thirties
 he snapped down his nose with an accent
 I think he had affected in England
  
 as for publishing he advised me
 to paper my wall with rejection slips
 his lips and the bones of his long fingers trembled
 with the vehemence of his views about poetry
  
 he said the great presence
 that permitted everything and transmuted it
 in poetry was passion
 passion was genius and he praised movement and invention
  
 I had hardly begun to read
 I asked how can you ever be sure
 that what you write is really
 any good at all and he said you can't
  
 you can't you can never be sure
 you die without knowing
 whether anything you wrote was any good
 if you have to be sure don't write

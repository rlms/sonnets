I

A cave with arms at the mouth.
Our hero is blind: everything he hears he sees.

Hear! Gold light sifts to his ear.
A roar. The seas
beaten—his duodenum, colon,
blind intestine and appendix, destined
for heat, they blush.

II

William's cabbage heart shook. 
He dragged himself from the dirt.

If he could rest his ears he could see 
ginkgos in his city. The pretty boy I mean
 & Will, who were both aging 
with their senses curbed until they knew
 New York City by the root & crack.

 III

As if there is a fig tree rooted in heaven 
& each of its leaves knows all the rules.

8:45 a.m. hum: he saw the boy had fallen
into a manhole & the fig tree had fallen into a manhole
& neither could be the sound of hands splitting
gold hands landed
up the breadth of William's back.

            God bleeding me a kind of blooded cry 
            my lady makes me a heron
            or my leg for a stump 
            the cursed in loam my 
            venomous thumbs my

His guts an a-readied muck.

IV

If your hand had been dusk-
yellow not a lantern but winged 
—a bridge or a dove sprung 
from the dirt.

Trying to make a shape. The feathered 
thumb herring—
bone. We would not fall.

V

I brought you in from the garden since I can't 
stand the trees' visions. William you will 
be there the last
 stately in ribbons.

But the vision is a fattened glee.
The glee is a clubfoot.
The glee is a mutt.
The eyes sewn up the air & nothing can be seen
but visions.

You are burst sideways like a fist in water. 
Your maker staring into an apron of mud.
 Thou art
           bore a hole in the man. 
Thou art
           not a bloody bit, not the man.

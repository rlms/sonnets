I need a strict manager
and an energetic secretary
and a correspondent to make my coffee
and my tea
I need an intellectual
and a poet
and a mafia godfather
to divide my life among them

And I'll announce, after a while
my bankruptcy
like the companies do

I need a servant
and a traitor
a lover to have me murdered
beaten to death
by sandals in the bath:
I need a queen
to betray me with the king

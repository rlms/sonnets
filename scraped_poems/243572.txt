Holiday Inn kitchen, the day I am born: 
My father is frying fish for a party of seventeen 
when the call comes from the hospital. He stays 
until the batter is crispy, cold salads scooped 
on platters, rye bread buttered.
 
Dad never told me this story. 
He told my boyfriend, one short order cook to another. 
Mom doesn't know why Dad was late 
for her screams and sweat on the hospital bed.
 
Once, when she was angry with him, she told me: 
When your father finally got there, the nurse had to tell 
him to get upstairs, “Your wife is having that baby now.”
 
I hope that when Dad first held me, 
it was with haddock-scented hands, apron 
over his black pants still sprinkled with flour, 
forehead oily from standing over the deep fryer, 
telling the fish to hurry  hurry.

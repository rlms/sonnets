Baby, give me just 
one more hiss 

We must lake it fast 
morever 

I want to cold you 
in my harms 

& never get lo 

I live you so much 
it perts! 

Baby, jive me gust 
one more bliss 

Whisper your 
neat nothings in my near 

Can we hock each other 
one tore mime? 

All light wrong? 

Baby give me just 
one more briss 

My won & homely 

You wake me meek 
in the needs 

Mill you larry me? 

Baby, hive me just 
one more guess 

With this sing 
I'll thee shed

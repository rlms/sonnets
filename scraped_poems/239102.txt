God knows how our neighbors manage to breathe.
No one is allowed 
to touch me

for infection is a hazard of mercy
I will not transmit
as Legion transcribed from the mouth

of Error into his body
and sent into a herd of swine
who sent it to the sea

who's been trying to return
to earth since creation
and nearly succeeds every day.

I just took my temperature.
98 degrees. I am better than healthy.
I am cooling even as earth

heats, even as it meets the sea
further inland and negotiates
distance from increasingly

disadvantaged position. I 
am cooling because nothing 
touches me.

Others may go to the petting zoo
and country fair
but don't even tell me what they touch

there. I'm taking my temperature again; 
my thermometer is digital and pink
and its beep is my name

being read from the book of life,
which is available on Kindle 
and allows me to avoid the public library

but contains peculiar punctuation
errors and is transcribed by
evangelists while they wait 

in line at gates you can't see from here. 98.5. 
Still cooler than life. I have another 
glass of water, and feel you turning in me,

my little book, flipping over and over,
it's time for bed little sow, little sow.
The book of death is open on my bedside

table and is called The Pregnancy

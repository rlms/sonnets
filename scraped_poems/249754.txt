what thoughts I have of you tonight, Du Bois 
of bodies rocked and minds embalmed in bark
 our blanched arrivalâ€”seethin with scandal's mark 
nowadays I peep you in the bean-pie seller's poise

with that silhouette fit for bust or cameo
I can't always divine your debonair birth
or your boocoo brain laborin like an earth
in hallelujah's ether, somehow duckin death's blow

sure sprung from Imhotep's kundalini 
stitchin white reconstruction's funeral shroud 
scriptin Philly dirges for the cryin out loud 
cussin Garvey's name over martinis

sometimes I wonder if you double agent on the page 
or mastermind of our ordered rage

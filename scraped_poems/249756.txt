after Billie
these vitamin double ds 
gonna put cows outta business.
 these Sunday bests 
if frozen would delight.
 unpasteurized & untamed 
they swing
 in the hammock 
of my torso.
 they magnetize 
my man's hands.
 like a Wonder Woman blast 
or a web of thunder from 
Storm's wrist, 
this cocktail 
is nurturing napalm 
manna dew, Pepto Bismol 
for civilization.
 you can't outwit these 
aureolas.
these nipples are 
necrophilia's enemy. 
Coltrane couldn't blow
 these tumescent tubas.
these are gourds 
that'll make a shekere 
obsolete,
make an eggplant 
go pale.
 these breasts 
gonna put old Betsy
outta business 
& send the men 
with goats a-packin. 
this love is like a faucet, 
it turns on & on.

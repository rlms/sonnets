The adults we call our children will not be arriving 
with their children in tow for Thanksgiving. 
We must make our feast ourselves, 

slice our half-ham, indulge, fill our plates, 
potatoes and green beans 
carried to our table near the window.

 We are the feast, plenty of years, 
arguments. I'm thinking the whole bundle of it 
rolls out like a white tablecloth. We wanted 

to be good company for one another. 
Little did we know that first picnic 
how this would go. Your hair was thick, 

mine long and easy; we climbed a bluff 
to look over a storybook plain. We chose 
our spot as high as we could, to see

 the river and the checkerboard fields. 
What we didn't see was this day, in 
our pajamas if we want to, 

wrinkled hands strong, wine
 in juice glasses, toasting 
whatever's next, 

the decades of side-by-side, 
our great good luck.

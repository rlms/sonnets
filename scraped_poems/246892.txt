there was a remember when the mama was my girl
the mama was in my girl biding to turn
my girl turn mama when what I got turn to girl in her
my girl in my girl make my girl mama 
they both mine
all three 

I remember a when when I only dreamed dreams 
but my dreams are remembers now
they a when

that when was when the girl I made of mama I made a mama with what I got 
I tell what I tell but I know what I know 
only a man make his dream a remember and ain't I a man
what's mine is mine to turn to what I dream 
what I make mine to make mine 
I won't 'bide what won't turn

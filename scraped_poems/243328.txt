Wheel me down to the shore 
where the lighthouse was abandoned 
and the moon tolls in the rafters.

Let me hear the wind paging through the trees
and see the stars flaring out, one by one, 
like the forgotten faces of the dead.

I was never able to pray, 
but let me inscribe my name 
in the book of waves

and then stare into the dome 
of a sky that never ends 
and see my voice sail into the night.

For D'Andra
My bowl brimming with pretzels, 
the snack you wanted least, 
I slid open the door of our sleeping car 
where we had been enjoying the country rushing by, 
as if   we were the first two people 
to look down into the valleys and see 
bright necks of pines stretch across farms 
and streams to the groves they once cradled. 
You had asked for Earl Grey cookies 
sandwiched around buttercream or marshmallows 
made of chocolate, but all the tea bags had been dunked 
and the chocolate melted over biscotti. 
When I came bearing the salted and twisted news, 
the room was empty but for a heel. It was black 
as a bunting, and wound with zippers, 
and every time the car rocked 
it looked ready to fly and escape 
into the cold, tangled air 
of   travel that always feels heavy 
with joy and desire, and a little sadness, 
always a little sadness, 
because of the leaving, which is what I do 
when I realize I'm in the wrong room 
and that numbers have betrayed me again 
while I was hunting and gathering, 
foraging like Homo habilis 
who probably never lost his cave. 

Out of patience, I opened every door 
marked with threes and eights, those conjoined twins 
disastrously separated at birth, 
and roused the scabbed eyes of sleepers 
like a beggar, no, an angel, 
a begging angel who has written on his heart 
will work for love. 
Having not found our room, not heard 
the sharp swing of   your voice, 
I descended upon the passenger cars 
and row upon row of couples asleep 
or staring out the windows like zombies 
trying to remember what happens next 
once the newspaper is well-thumbed, 
the tea has gone cold, and the conversation is dead. 

I called for you, in vain, even using your secret names, 
the ones only the night knows: 
wind-kiss, brilliant-fruit, dervish-moon    . . . 
Over and over, I said your names, 
over and over until they filled 
the wounded air of  the car 
and when there was no more room 
for another sound, they caught and hooked 
the ring of   the brakes hugging the rails. 

Just when I thought I wouldn't find you, 
you were there, the train was pulling away, 
and I was watching you slowly eat 
a dish of whipped cream and bananas
— the house special — in a cafe 
in a city we didn't know. 
When you finished, we started walking 
down a road that bent like a smile, 
a shy smile, like the one the Japanese cat wore 
on your purse. The road, we were told, 
would take us to the end of   the line 
where all lovers in search of   joy 
packed on bullet trains — they're the fastest 
on two continents — arrive every hour.

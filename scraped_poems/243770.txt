For Arnold Rampersad 

Shadows bluing the snow, the pines' and mine, 
bear the cast of a kestrel's blue-gray crown 
I note as I find my way about this town. 

Blues here more likely the Nordic-eyes kind 
than the blue-black of some Black folk back home.
Here so many lakes reflect the sky's blue dome; 

some summer days skimmed-milk blue tints windblown 
whitecaps. Blue's an adjective, verb, and noun, 
and the color of the world when I pine 

because she's gone leaving too much wine and time. 
Blue shadows on the snow, mine and the pines'. 
For a tall man, blue ox, and now me, home 

is Bemidji, though the blues here around 
more the cast of a kestrel's blue-gray crown 
than the blue-black of my cousins back home.

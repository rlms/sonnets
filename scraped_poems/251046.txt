I loved a girl
when I was a girl,

before I knew desire
could be used against me.

I so wanted to be relevant.
Simple exchangeâ€”

bouquets of wheat.
My dirt-stained hands,

tangled hair. I never
could be prim,

in apple-pie order.
I dropped all the eggs,

licking their smear
off my hands;

wrinkled her ribbons
into my pocket,

tore pages from her books,
all for the sake

of the lonely hour.

Compiling this landmark anthology of poetry in English
 about dogs and musical instruments is like swimming through bricks. 
 To date, I have only, “On the Death of Mrs. McTuesday's Pug,
 Killed by a Falling Piano,” a somewhat obvious choice. 
 True, an Aeolian harp whispers alluringly 
 in the background of the anonymous sonnet, “The Huntsman's
       Hound,” 
 but beyond that — silence. 

 I should resist this degrading donkey-work in favor of my own
       writing, 
 wherein contentment surely lies. 
 But A. Smith stares smugly from the reverse of the twenty pound
       note, 
 and when my bank manager guffaws, 
 small particles of saliva stream like a meteor shower 
 through the infinity of dark space 
between his world and mine.

Next to the screen door 
work boots dry in the sun. 
Salt lines map the leather 
and laces droop
like the arms of a new-hire 
waiting to punch out. 
The shoe hangs open like the sigh 
of someone too tired to speak 
a mouth that can almost breathe. 
A tear in the leather reveals 
a shiny steel toe 
a glimpse of the promise of safety 
the promise of steel and the years to come.

I uproot & save 
mental venture

I split the dream 
of the slow 
& neutral

Persist 
& breathe

My little flask

Pointy wisp

Pubescent valve

Join
the game

I smoke
& praise you

Hew
& raze you

Jungle 
kill

Bulldoze 
your sierra

Fire 
to ash

I wait 
& wait

And you 
where are you

Fragrant 
lantana

Aim
 your voice

In calm
 plains

In silence
 wild

Erasing
 the thirst

The weightless
 altar

insults 
the blood

Awake 
diagonals

Rot
& Stand

Go & go

Flower
gaining

Plant your will!

The eagle floats and glides,
circling the burnished aspen,

then takes the high pines
with a flash of underwing.

As surely as the eagle sails
toward the bay's open curve,

as surely as he swoops and seizes
the struggling fish, pulling

it from an osprey's beak;
so too, autumn descends,

to steal the glistening
summer from our open hands.

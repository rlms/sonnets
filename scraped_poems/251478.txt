Gather 'round, ye scurvy mates,
I'm signing on a crew.
 
You there! Can ye tie a knot?
Ye'll do.
 
I'd say you've snatched a purse or two.
Ye'll do.
 
Does the thought of plundered gold
make ye shiver?
Make ye bold?
Ye'll do.
 
Ha! You're rotten through and through!
Ye'll do.
 
Phew! You stinking, drunken lout!
You'd whack your uncle's gizzard out!
Well step right up!
Beyond a doubt
ye'll do!

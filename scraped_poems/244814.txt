Cards in each mailbox, 
angel, manger, star and lamb, 
as the rural carrier, 
driving the snowy roads, 
hears from her bundles 
the plaintive bleating of sheep, 
the shuffle of sandals, 
the clopping of camels. 
At stop after stop, 
she opens the little tin door 
and places deep in the shadows 
the shepherds and wise men, 
the donkeys lank and weary, 
the cow who chews and muses. 
And from her Styrofoam cup, 
white as a star and perched 
on the dashboard, leading her 
ever into the distance, 
there is a hint of hazelnut, 
and then a touch of myrrh.

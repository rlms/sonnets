To claim, at a dead party, to have spotted a grackle, 
When in fact you haven't of late, can do no harm. 
Your reputation for saying things of interest 
Will not be marred, if you hasten to other topics, 
Nor will the delicate web of human trust 
Be ruptured by that airy fabrication. 
Later, however, talking with toxic zest 
Of golf, or taxes, or the rest of it 
Where the beaked ladle plies the chuckling ice, 
You may enjoy a chill of severance, hearing 
Above your head the shrug of unreal wings. 
Not that the world is tiresome in itself: 
We know what boredom is: it is a dull 
Impatience or a fierce velleity, 
A champing wish, stalled by our lassitude, 
To make or do. In the strict sense, of course, 
We invent nothing, merely bearing witness 
To what each morning brings again to light: 
Gold crosses, cornices, astonishment 
Of panes, the turbine-vent which natural law 
Spins on the grill-end of the diner's roof, 
Then grass and grackles or, at the end of town 
In sheen-swept pastureland, the horse's neck 
Clothed with its usual thunder, and the stones 
Beginning now to tug their shadows in 
And track the air with glitter. All these things 
Are there before us; there before we look 
Or fail to look; there to be seen or not 
By us, as by the bee's twelve thousand eyes, 
According to our means and purposes. 
So too with strangeness not to be ignored, 
Total eclipse or snow upon the rose, 
And so with that most rare conception, nothing. 
What is it, after all, but something missed? 
It is the water of a dried-up well 
Gone to assail the cliffs of Labrador. 
There is what galled the arch-negator, sprung 
From Hell to probe with intellectual sight 
The cells and heavens of a given world 
Which he could take but as another prison: 
Small wonder that, pretending not to be, 
He drifted through the bar-like boles of Eden 
In a black mist low creeping, dragging down 
And darkening with moody self-absorption 
What, when he left it, lifted and, if seen 
From the sun's vantage, seethed with vaulting hues. 
Closer to making than the deftest fraud 
Is seeing how the catbird's tail was made 
To counterpoise, on the mock-orange spray, 
Its light, up-tilted spine; or, lighter still, 
How the shucked tunic of an onion, brushed 
To one side on a backlit chopping-board 
And rocked by trifling currents, prints and prints 
Its bright, ribbed shadow like a flapping sail. 
Odd that a thing is most itself when likened: 
The eye mists over, basil hints of clove, 
The river glazes toward the dam and spills 
To the drubbed rocks below its crashing cullet, 
And in the barnyard near the sawdust-pile 
Some great thing is tormented. Either it is 
A tarp torn loose and in the groaning wind 
Now puffed, now flattened, or a hip-shot beast 
Which tries again, and once again, to rise. 
What, though for pain there is no other word, 
Finds pleasure in the cruellest simile? 
It is something in us like the catbird's song 
From neighbor bushes in the grey of morning 
That, harsh or sweet, and of its own accord, 
Proclaims its many kin. It is a chant 
Of the first springs, and it is tributary 
To the great lies told with the eyes half-shut 
That have the truth in view: the tale of Chiron 
Who, with sage head, wild heart, and planted hoof 
Instructed brute Achilles in the lyre, 
Or of the garden where we first mislaid 
Simplicity of wish and will, forgetting 
Out of what cognate splendor all things came 
To take their scattering names; and nonetheless 
That matter of a baggage-train surprised 
By a few Gascons in the Pyrenees 
Which, having worked three centuries and more 
In the dark caves of France, poured out at last 
The blood of Roland, who to Charles his king 
And to the dove that hatched the dove-tailed world 
Was faithful unto death, and shamed the Devil.

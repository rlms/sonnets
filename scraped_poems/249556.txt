It was Christmastime, 
the balloons needed blowing, 
and so in the evening
 we sat together to blow 
balloons and tell jokes, 
and the cool air off the hills 
made me think of coffee, 
so I said, “Coffee would be nice,” 
and he said, “Yes, coffee 
would be nice,” and smiled 
as his thin fingers pulled
 the balloons from the plastic bags; 
so I went for coffee, 
and it takes a few minutes 
to make the coffee 
and I did not know 
if he wanted cow's milk
 or condensed milk,
 and when I came out 
to ask him, he was gone, 
just like that, in the time 
it took me to think, 
cow's milk or condensed;
 the balloons sat lightly 
on his still lap.

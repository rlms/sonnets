This is my last report:
I wanted to speak of existence, the ants most of all,
dressed up in their naughty flame-trousers, the exact jaws,
their unknowable kindnesses, their abyss of hungers,
and science, their mercilessness, their prophetic military
devotions, their geometry of scent, their cocoons
for the Nomenclature,

I wanted to speak of the Glue Sniffers 
and Glue Smoothers who despise all forms 
unbound, loose in their amber nectars, I wanted 
to point to their noses, hoses and cables and networks, 
their tools, if I can use that word now—and scales and 
scanners and Glue Rectories.

I wanted you to meet my broom mother 
who carved a hole into her womb 
so that I could live—

At every sunset she stands
under the shadow of the watchtowers
elongating and denying her breath.

I wanted to look under the rubble fields 
for once, for you (if you approved), flee 
into the bullet-riddled openness and fall flat,
 arched, askew, under the rubble sheets 
and let the rubble fill me

with its sharp plates and ripped dust—
 alphabets incomplete and humid. You, 
listen,

a little closer
to the chalk dust—this child swinging her left arm,
a ribbon, agitated by unnamed forces, devoured.

i was left out
i was chosen second & then left out
i was left
handed  i was left
to fend for myself   i 
was the second in
command  the second
in line   i came
without direction

            *
i want the 
milk  i want my
first pick  i want
choice   & all its implications  there was a

            *
residue of
scar
between us  it chafed
when we rubbed our
chests together

            *
                                     hello, brother, hello?
hello in there, brother, can you
hear me?  it's a long
tunnel to the grave    speak

you were my
first god  i was rapt in your
coming
                         (mother better
eat her vegetables, she better chew) choo
choo

what's bitter between us

            *
                                              i want the
milk  i need it for my
teeth  they're
soft  the gums
bleed  there's the evidence

on my toothbrush  i got the
second draft  i need calcium
to make up  i

got a job
             & left
i don't know where you're
buried

            *
what do you
need?  what will make you
happy?  what do you
want?  the dead
do have mouths &
appetites  suck it
up   there's plenty in the ice
box   more
where that came from

            *
                                      if somebody
asked me what's
next  i wouldn't
know  i took my hands off
her like something
hot  or fragile   or in
pain  i was
aghast  at suffering how you can feed
& feed it
               & it's never
full

            *
                          there's a separation
between us  a suppuration  there's just the  
space of an idea  i don't know what's
missing  it's a blind
spot  sometimes my left eye
focuses & it's like looking at
both of us through a
window

            *
                                    i'm telling you the
facts of life for
you haven't been told
you're in your late
fifties  you're dis-
eased or disinterested  a
queer unable to
come out of the casket  OK

            *
you live this
life  i'll live the
next  she only has enough milk for
one baby  i'll go 
around this
time  you come the
next  that time you'll have a
better mother i

promise you that

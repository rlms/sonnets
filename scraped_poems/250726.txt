But what lovers we were, what lovers, 
even when it was all overâ€” 

the bull-black, deadweight wines that we swung
 towards each other rang and rang 

like bells of blood, our own great hearts. 
We slung the drunk boat out of port 

and watched our sober unreal life 
unmoor, a continent of grief; 

the candlelight strange on our faces 
like the tiny silent blazes 

and coruscations of its wars. 
We blew them out and took the stairs

into the night for the night's work,
 stripped off in the timbered dark,

gently hooked each other on 
like aqualungs, and thundered down 

to mine our lovely secret wreck. 
We surfaced later, breathless, back 

to back, and made our way alone 
up the mined beach of the dawn.

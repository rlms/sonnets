We've come back to the site of   her
conception. She calls it why 

and cries all night, 
sleepless, wild.

It seems the way is always
floating and the goal — 

to live so the ghosts we were 
don't trail us and echo.

I think we are inside a flower,
under a pollen of stars vast as scattered sand.

The air pulses with perfume,
flowers calling to flowers and the ferrying air.

But my eyes are thin and elsewhere.
I am thinking, maybe 

even coming into the soul 
is a difficult birth, squeezed by the body's vise.

My bent legs like pincers
or the vegetable petals of some tropical flower.

Even my mind gripped by the folds 
of   the flesh, how the cells keep twinning 

themselves out toward complexity.
The tulip trees of   the valley

spread their bone canopies into slick green leaves 
and fire flowers deep as cups.

Their cups fill with rain, rain 
drinks the leaves drinking rain.

I can't begin to explain.
How on this porous peak of stone in the sea

our daughter came into me.
Little flick of a fish I could not see.

I was just learning to be human 
and upright among all that life.

And what was real was stranger
than night with its dust of unnamed suns.

It was the beyond in us. And she was.

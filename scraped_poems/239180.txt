The fork lived with the knife
      and found it hard — for years
 took nicks and scratches,
      not to mention cuts.
  
 She who took tedium by the ears:
      nonforthcoming pickles,
 defiant stretched-out lettuce,
      sauce-gooed particles.
  
 He who came down whack.
 His conversation, even, edged.
  
 Lying beside him in the drawer
      she formed a crazy patina.
 The seasons stacked — 
      melons, succeeded by cured pork.
  
 He dulled; he was a dull knife,
 while she was, after all, a fork.

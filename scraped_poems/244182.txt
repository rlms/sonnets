I had just hung up from talking to you
and we had been so immersed in the difficulty
you were facing, and forgive me,
I was thinking that as long as we kept talking,
you in your car in the parking lot of the boys' school
as the afternoon deepened into early evening,
and me in the study, all the books around
that had been sources of beauty to us,
as long as we stayed in the conversation
padded with history like the floor of the pine forest, 
as long as I thought out loud, made a joke
at my own expense, you would be harbored in that exchange, 
but the boys were leaving the track
and after we hung up I looked out the window 
to see the top of the bare January trees spotlit to silvery red, 
massive but made from the thinnest
twigs at the ends of the branches at the ends of the limbs
they were waving and shining in a light
like no other and left only to them.

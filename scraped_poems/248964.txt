You have a strange pet — 
one eye is a cat's, the other a sheep's.
Yet, it won't socialize with felines,
will attack any flock.
On moonlit nights,
it wanders on the roof.

When you're alone
it will lie in your lap
preoccupied, slowly studying you
until — on its face — a challenge.


Translated from the Chinese

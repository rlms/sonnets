For Mimi Khalvati
Why go? Partly because we had no reason 
To, though, granted, Hastings's on the Channel— 
Which meant salt air and, that day, winter sun. 
A zigzag swing from station down to shingle

To take in the cold light and arrowy
 Jeers shrilled by veering scavengers overhead, 
Who flirted, razzed, then flapped and rowed away, 
Our tentative footsteps fumbling pebbles, dead

Shellfish, kelp, plastic bits. A backtrack trek
To lunch should keep mild melancholy at
Bay, even if the loose-ends, fifties-flick
Ambience was what we'd come for. Or part of what.

Later, our huff-puff climb uphill for the ruins' 
Majestic overviews, in guidebook blather. 
One silver path across the waves to France, 
And the long, incoming roar of faith from farther

East. (Or west: fanaticism's viral. 
Numbing to think about the human cost.) 
Sunset. Time to unwind a dawdling spiral
 Down to the mall—where it dawns on us we're lost.

Suppose we ask this sporty adolescent. 
"The station? Oh, no problem. Bang a right 
Up there, then left, and on along the Crescent 
About two minutes, and Bob's your uncle, mate."

You smiled, interpreted—but then you would,

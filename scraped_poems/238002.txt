Right hand graced with writing,
my left arm my secondhand new
suit bestrode, from the auto I
say, “Antinous, perched like a
parakeet cracking sunflower seeds
in a hot ice cave or cage,
you're an apogee. Acid pennies
will fill your mouth, your head
bowl at a soldiers' revel. Fly
the safety you despise and seek,
a butcher with a butcher's knife
peers. The lice are fast. Ta ta.”

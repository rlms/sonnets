from the waist–so that, turned the bulb that's oneself (thorax) 
–only–then–doesn't have any existence–turned (wherever one 
turns) 
    as conception–at waist of magnolia buds that exist in the day 
really 
    sewing the black silk irises–not when one turned at waist 
    sewing them, they have no shape literally except being that– 
from one's hand (being, in the air) 
    the irises only had existence in the black, before dawn, in fact 
    a man doesn't want me to become quiet again–go into ocean 
not weighed of before fighting–ever 

    formation of that of narrowed to no form in one–of black volup- 
tuous lip–outside–voluptuous lips that (aren't) on black dawn, or 
before it when it's black. 
    There was no intention–being done–with their existing. 

    not weighed before fighting which is the black, weighed, air– 
not the lips which have no weight–isn't following 
    if one's not contending...so the inner isn't contending either...?

So I'm an alcoholic Catholic mother-lover
yet there is no sweetish nectar no fuzzed-peach
thing no song sing but in the word 
which I'm starlessly unreachably faithful 
you, pedant & you, politically righteous & you, alive
 you think you can peal my sober word apart from my drunken word
my Buddhist word apart from my white sugar Thérèse word my
word to comrade from my word to my mother
but all my words are one word my lives one
my last to first wound round in finally fiberless crystalline skein

I began as a drunkard & ended as a child
I began as an ordinary cruel lover & ended as a boy who
                               read radiant newsprint
I began physically embarrassing—"bloated"—&
                               ended as a perfect black-haired laddy
I began unnaturally subservient to my mother &
                               ended in the crib of her goldenness
I began in a fatal hemorrhage & ended in a
                               tiny love's body perfect smallest one

But I began in a word & I ended in a word &                              
                               I know that word better 
Than any knows me or knows that word,
                               probably, but I only asked to know it— 
That word is the word when I say me bloated
                               & when I say me manly it's
 The word that word I write perfectly lovingly
                               one & one after the other one

But you—you can only take it when it's that one & not
                               some other one
 Or you say "he lost it" as if I (I so nothinged) could ever
                               lose the word 
But when there's only one word—when
                               you know them, the words— 
The words are all only one word the perfect
                               word— 
My body my alcohol my pain my death are only
                               the perfect word as I
Tell it to you, poor sweet categorizers
                               Listen 
Every me I was & wrote
                               were only & all (gently)
 That one perfect word

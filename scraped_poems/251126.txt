breezy, floral, dancing with color
 soft, silky, flows as I walk 
Easter Sunday and you always liked 

to get dressed, go for brunch, "maybe 
there's a good movie playing somewhere?" 
Wrong religion, we were not church-goers, 

but New Yorkers who understood the value 
of a parade down 5th Avenue, bonnets
 in lavender, powder blues, pinks, hues 

of spring, the hope it would bring.
 We had no religion but we did have
 noodle kugel, grandparents, dads 

who could fix fans, reach the china
 on the top shelf, carve the turkey. 
That time has passed. You were the last

 to go, mom, and I still feel bad I never
 got dressed up for you like you wanted me to. 
I had things, things to do. But today in L.A.— 

hot the way you liked it—those little birds 
you loved to see flitting from tree to tree— 
just saw one, a twig in its mouth, preparing 

a bed for its baby—might still be an egg, 
I wish you were here. I've got a closet filled 
with dresses I need to show you.

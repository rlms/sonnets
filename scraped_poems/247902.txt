Liar, I thought, kneeling with the others,
 how can He love me and hate what I am?
 The dome of St. Peter's shone yellowish
 gold, like butter and eggs. My God, I prayed
 anyhow, as if made in the image
 and likeness of Him. Nearby, a handsome
 priest looked at me like a stone; I looked back,
 not desiring to go it alone.
 The college of cardinals wore punitive red.
 The white spine waved to me from his white throne.
 Being in a place not my own, much less
 myself, I climbed out, a beast in a crib.
 Somewhere a terrorist rolled a cigarette.
 Reason, not faith, would change him.

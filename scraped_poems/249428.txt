I lived between my heart and my head, 
like a married couple who can't get along. 

I lived between my left arm, which is swift 
and sinister, and my right, which is righteous. 

I lived between a laugh and a scowl, 
and voted against myself, a two-party system. 

My left leg dawdled or danced along, 
my right cleaved to the straight and narrow. 

My left shoulder was like a stripper on vacation, 
my right stood upright as a Roman soldier. 

Let's just say that my left side was the organ 
donor and leave my private parts alone,

 but as for my eyes, which are two shades 
of brown, well, Dionysus, meet Apollo. 

Look at Eve raising her left eyebrow 
while Adam puts his right foot down. 

No one expected it to survive, 
but divorce seemed out of the question. 

I suppose my left hand and my right hand 
will be clasped over my chest in the coffinÂ 

 and I'll be reconciled at last,
 I'll be whole again.

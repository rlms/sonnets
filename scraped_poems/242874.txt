Women asleep. Carlight,
east red and west white.

Women, and men made of them,
and lambs in their droves, and power lines east

to the women-made men and women of men,
when a man is a sum
of what women he knows, and I 

blurred my vision till I
saw a woman and lambs in the streets,
west red and white east,

and I wanted to eat. Women and men,
don't fear me, I am 
a hand come to wake her. Red 

in the west says
woman is man is woman is man.

Come March we'd find them 
In the five-and-dimes, 
Furled tighter than umbrellas 
About their slats, the air

In an undertow above us
Like weather on the maps. 
We'd play out lines
Of kite string, tugging against

The bucking sideways flights. 
Readied for assembly,
I'd arc the tensed keel of balsa 
Into place against the crosspiece,

Feeling the paper snap 
 Tautly as a sheet, then lift
 The almost weightless body 
Up to where it hauled me

Trolling into the windsâ€” 
Knotted bows like vertebrae 
Flashing among fields
Of light. Why ruin it

By recalling the aftermaths? 
Kites gone down in tatters, 
Kites fraying like flotsam 
From the tops of the trees.

We come gnawed by need on hands and knees.


As a creature (nosing) grubble-seeks a spring.


As bendy-spined as bandy snakes through saltshrub yaupon 
                                                                                                      needle-brake.


For darkling green;
for thorn-surround.


This absorbing


quaggy
crample-ground.


Of   briar-canes (intervolved with kudzu-mesh) and mold.


Of   these convoluted vines we grasp to suck.


To taste the pith —
the lumen the cell-sap pulse.


To try to know


some (soursharp) something about something.


Lumen is as lumen does.


‘A little room for turmoil to grow lucid in.'

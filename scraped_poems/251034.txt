The eyes on a face have brought me sadness: 
the right eye searching for seams in ripped fishnets; 
the left eye lost and wandering the dark; the eye 
of the baby god crawling behind a couch in the moist 
suburb where we planned our escape from video games 
and grilled cheese; the eye of a whale we met in a dream 
who spit us out so we could make the 8 o'clock screening 
of On Golden Pond; the eye of the clock, blinking
 when the oboe wailed like a burning shofar; the eye
 inside the eye, curled up—a sprouting lima bean, 
remembering the nineteenth century, those rosy drapes;
 the eyes of missing finger tips, of sad afternoons 
in French cafés in Dayton, Ohio; the eyes on the very 
real parrot who sits on the shoulders of a wax actor
 dressed as a pirate; the eyes of an actress, pretending 
to be my mom; the eyes of my father, sleeping on a train, 
dreaming about miniature crashing planes; the eyes 
of a swimming pool, looking up or down everyone's
 swimsuits and into their souls; the eyes in love 
songs written by mean men; the eyes in the painting 
lost in a fire where we tried to save the ancient cat;
 the eyes underneath tap shoes clicking like teeth; 
the eyes of Fred Astaire, never blinking, even to kiss
 in the dark; the eyes of the state of Texas secretly
 tattooed on everyone's ass, and the eyes on the billboard, 
ripped and faded from rain like the eyes of the best waitress
 on the Upper West Side who knows everyone's order, 
even those of customers she's never met. 
Can you hear  the eyes under my eyes? 
They steal other people's dreams to use them for ad copy. 
Here are the eyes of a man who'd be my husband if he
 hadn't married my twin, and there are the eyes of the judge 
who divorced them, blue as his tie. I forget the eye color 
of the first man I loved—what color was my hat when we cried
 in the snow? The whites of everyone's eyes swirl together
 in silent music. Nothing like the closed eyes of a flamenco dancer, 
eating a dripping hamburger by the highway. Instead it is 
the right eye of a teacher when she touches her student; 
the eyes inside my mouth and the eyes outside your mouth;
 the eyes of the writer and reader, a broken vase and a whole petal; 
the eyes on what you thought of as a cunt and the eyes 
on what I thought of as a cock; the small eyes on the open book 
and the bigger eyes of the closed book; the eyes I swallow 
when we talk, and the eyes that fly above us in sleep.

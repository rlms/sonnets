I want the hole in my ear to be quiet
And inside the hole in my ear to be quiet
And I want it to tell me what to do
Or I will go to my lover's mouth
And say oh my quiet
I am coming
And tell the quiet how its kingdom should be made
Though the quiet has already eaten me
Because the quiet loves me
But does the lover love me
And why must the quiet be so quiet
And why can't the quiet have a cock
And where is its violet mouth
Its ten fingers with which to fix me
And where is its belly breathing
And O I want to be fixed
But I am already fixed
Why don't I feel it

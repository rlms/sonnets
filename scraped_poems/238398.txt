When I see the cradle rocking 
What is it that I see?
I see a rood on the hilltop
        Of Calvary.

When I hear the cattle lowing 
What is it that they say?
They say that shadows feasted
        At Tenebrae.

When I know that the grave is empty,
Absence eviscerates me,
And I dwell in a cavernous, constant

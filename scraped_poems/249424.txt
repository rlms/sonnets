Toward evening, the natural light becomes 
 intelligent and answers, without demur: 
 “Be assured! You are not alone. . . .” 
 But in fact, toward evening, I am not 
 convinced there is any other except myself 
 to whom existence necessarily pertains. 
 I also interrogate myself to discover 
 whether I myself possess any power 
 by which I can bring it about that I 
 who now am shall exist another moment.

 Because I am mostly a thinking thing
 and because this precise question can only
 be from that thoughtful part of myself,
 if such a power did reside within me
 I should, I am sure, be conscious of it. . . .
 But I am conscious of no such power.
 And yet, if I myself cannot be
 the cause of that assurance, surely
 it is necessary to conclude that
 I am not alone in the world. There is

 some other who is the cause of that idea. 
 But if, at last, no such other can be 
 found toward evening, do I really have 
 sufficient assurance of the existence 
 of any other being at all? For, 
 after a most careful search, I have been 
 unable to discover the ground of that 
 conviction—unless it be imagined a lonely 
 workman on a dizzy scaffold unfolds 
 a sign at evening and puts his mark to it.

i read your poem 
over and over 
in this landscape 
of women

women purring 
on balconies 
overlooking 
the indigo sea

my mother's 
blue taffeta dress 
is black as the sea

she glides
out my door
to the beach
where sleek white boats
are anchored
under a full,
luscious moon

still
i am still
the wind
outside my window
my mother's ghost
evaporates
in the long
atlantic night

i listen to the radio 
every chance i get
for news
 of your city's 
latest disaster

everything here
the color of honey and sand
everything there
verges on catastrophe
a constant preoccupation
with real estate

everything here 
a calm horizon
 taut bodies 
carefully nurtured 
oiled & gleaming 
hair & skin

i read your poem
 over and over
 turning my head 
from prying eyes 
the low hum 
of women singing
 in another room

i switch stations 
on the radio 
turn up the volume
 i almost touch
the air
buzzing electricity

james brown "live at the apollo" 
the smooth female d.j. 
interrupts bo diddley 
groaning "i'm a man"

it is a joke here
in this baby-blue resort
where art
is a full-time hobby
art
is what everyone
claims to do

women sprawl
like cats
on each other's laps
licking the salt
off each other's skin

and i walk
in search
of the portuguese fishermen
who hide
in the scorched trees
the bleak, blond dunes
that line the highway

i imagine 
you asleep 
in another city
i take your poem
apart
line by line

it is a love letter
we wrote each other
some time ago
trying in vain to pinpoint
that first, easy
thrill.

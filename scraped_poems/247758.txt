We send him away oncemore knowing he'll return to watch. We're photographers shooting on locationfor Sylvia Plath's upcoming book, Savage Beauty—wrong poet or wrong book,I know, depending on how you look at it—however, I'm the one who is whitethis time, you're darker, maybe Quechua Indian or Spanish, like actor AntonioBanderas, with very defined stomach muscles and a slick throb of a penis.Years later I write a book about our affair. They bring me on one of thosedaytime talk shows, and before being reunited, we are kept in separate rooms, thetelevision split screen, green-towel man in the audience. I'm still white, so are you,both of us middle-aged with freckles and strawberry-blonde hair. Later I'm theviewer at home thinking, Like hell they'll fall for each other.

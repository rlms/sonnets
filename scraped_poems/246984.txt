That we go back to life one day, the next,
Some other century where we were alive,

When music spelled itself out to us, often
Incomplete, and nothing was more vague

Than the banality of â€Šwhom to love and lose
In line, the doppelgangers in rimless snow,

Or even now, in summer, at day, by night,
When something oblivious, replete, turns

Back at us in idolatrous quiet, so we see
Who in nullified particulars we really are

At a desk of our own making, filling in for
Someone else's life sentence, blots drying

On a silk tie having no meaning but today's,
When the loner puts his insomnia to rest.

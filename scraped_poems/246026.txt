The Traveler's Vade Mecum, line 4234
Baking two parts flour to one part water 
could stop a bullet. So good soldiers 
carried their hardtack over their hearts. 
Break it down with a rifle butt, flood it, 
fry it in pig fat to make hellfire stew.
Gnaw it raw and praise the juice.

Does wheat prepare for this as it grows,
seeking the light in a half-thawed field?
Do stalks know their strength is merely 
in their number? What is ground down
we name flour in promise that it will be 
made useful. Otherwise, it's just dust. 

Sheet iron crackers. 
Teeth-dullers.
Would you call it starving, if a man dies
with hardtack still tucked in his pocket?
Can you call it food, if the bullet comes only
at the moment he gives in and swallows?

To make beauty out of pain, it damns the eyesâ€”
No, dams the eyes. See how they overflow?
No damns them, damns them, and so they cry.
What shape can I swallow to make me whole?
Baby's bird-shaped block, blue-painted wood
That fits in the bird-hole of the painted wood box?
The skeleton leaf? The skeleton key? Loud
Knock when the shape won't unlock any locks.
I hear it through the static in the baby's room
When the monitor clicks on and off, sound
Of sea-ice cracking against the jagged sea-rocks,
Laughing gull in the gale. What is it dives down
Past sight, down there dark with the other blocks?
It can't be seen, only heard. A kind of curse,
This kind curse. Forgive me. Blessing that hurts.

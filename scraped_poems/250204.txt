Took me awhile to learn the good words
make the rain on my window grown
and sexy now I'm in the tub holding down
that on-sale Bordeaux pretending
to be well adjusted I am on that real
jazz shit sometimes I run the streets
sometimes they run me I'm the body
of the queen of my hood filled up
with bad wine bad drugs mu shu pork
sick beats what more can I say to you
I open my stylish legs I get my swagger
back let men with gold teeth bow to my tits
and the blisters on my feet I become electric
I'm a patch of grass the stringy roots
you call home or sister if you want
I could scratch your eyes make hip-hop die again
I'm on that grown woman shit before I break
the bottle's neck I pour a little out: I am fallen

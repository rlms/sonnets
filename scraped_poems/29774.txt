We are waiting, grandmother and I, for the white bird.
 The black bird grows larger above our heads,
 Its immense wings spreading as it dives down
 To pull her away piece by piece.
 Grandmother is not ashamed;
 She lies open before me, white as bone,
 Glistening with morphine, giving me this last gift.
 The hungry bird chitters and squawks, circling.
 I will stay until the bones are picked clean;
 I will stay until the wide wings swallow the last of the light,
 Until the white bird is free at last.

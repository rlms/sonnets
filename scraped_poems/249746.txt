Then, take this tambourine 
inside the sheep barn,

listen to the anaconda's intestines, 
the shark's walking stick,

learn the river insect's secret 
neon calligraphy,

swim through Frida Khalo's hair 
and come out smelling like orchids,

lift your appetite
towards the certified blue turtle,

feast on Garcia Lorca's leather shoes 
and taste the sun, the worms of Andalusia,

don't hesitate in front of a donut, 
a ferris wheel, the crab nebula,

excavate diamond-eyed demons, 
Chaucer's liver, Minoan helmets,

paste Anne Sexton's face on a $1,000 bill 
and purchase a dozen metaphors,

beware of the absolute scorpion, 
the iguana with the limping leg,

permit indwelling, white words around the eyes, 
the confrontation of windows,

never feed your towel to the alligator, 
he will eat you and eat you and eat you.

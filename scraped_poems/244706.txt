If our view were not a Holiday Inn
but a fringe of trees, I could say G here
is our greenly hidden.
                                          If we lived 
amid Joe-Pye weed and high grass 
instead of spackle and peeling plaster 
I could say perhaps
                                  I'm listening to G now 
but mean the owl, a wind playing the silo, 
a sticking sorrow,
                               any sound but the snore 
of our latest visitor on the futon. Dear G, 
please make him turn, make me kinder. 
I'm not far from unfathoming it all.

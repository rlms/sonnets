There was a melon fresh from the garden
So ripe the knife slurped 
As it cut it into six slices. 
The children were going back to school.
Their mother, passing out paper plates,
Would not live to see the leaves fall. 

I remember a hornet, too, that flew in
Through the open window 
Mad to taste the sweet fruit
While we ducked and screamed,
Covered our heads and faces,
And sat laughing after it was gone.

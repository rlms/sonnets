You'd been gone four months by then, 
but we brought you along anyway.

 On my back, you rested 
riding inside a wooden box.

 The idea was to lay you gently 
at the water's surface,

but our clumsy hands spilled you, 
and it was hard to tell whether you went head 

or feet first, but it didn't much matter 
anyway, I suppose. 

You would float on down the creek
 until you had reached the next and so on. 

My father gave a little wave and joked,
 “We'll see you back on down in Denver, Dad.” 

We stood there in silence
 listening to you chuckle 

under the bridge and over
 the first set of riffles downstream.

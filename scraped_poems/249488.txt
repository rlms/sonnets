They found you under twenty feet
of loose ash — one vowel
solo in an archipelago

of strung-out vowels and doting volcanoes — 
Isole Eolie — O hoop
of exhilaration, O sigh of relief

softening your votive mouth
if not blowing off steam
at the crater rim, crystalizing sulfur,

poring over tomes, the trade winds
and furies that fan through your realm,
O citizen-king, O sonorous persona

weaned on fumes and that old
itinerant intonation — air
your woes all over again.

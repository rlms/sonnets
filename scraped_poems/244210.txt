It ends because the beginning won't jumpstart 
again: red smudge of a mouth, lipstick everywhere

the afterthought a comet leaves on its way 
out. What makes this moment unfold like a fine 

woman raising herself up from the bathroom floor? 
Honky-tonk in the honeyed brown of an eyeball? 

Perfume & its circus of heart-shaped introductions? 
It ends because the needle always winds up in 

the lead-out, like a man pawing around for broken 
spectacles after he wakes in the world's rubble. 

Hand over hand he paws, through stilted guitar 
picks & abandoned stilettos, raised skirts & rocks, 

glasses as chipped & smudged as the topography 
of a skipping record. He could be Albright 

himself, foraging the still-life swish of low-rise 
tutus & skyscrapers cracked in the twisted 

aftermath of a smile. Even without glasses, 
he remembers her in high style: magnanimously 

coming down the blue & violet threads of night, 
her green dress clashing with the bathroom tile.

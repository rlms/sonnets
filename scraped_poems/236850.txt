Touch and go. Our Cessna bumped the sand,
       thumped its tundra tires,
       lifted as if on wires,
banked over ice and rocked its wings to land.

We pitched our camp hard by the Hubbard's face,
       some sixty fathoms tall,
       a seven-mile-long wall
seven leagues from Yakutat, our base.

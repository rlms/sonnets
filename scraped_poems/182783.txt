I am the last woman off of the plane 
that has crashed in a cornfield near Philly, 

picking through hot metal 
for my rucksack and diaper bag. 

No black box, no fuselage, 
just sistergirl pilot wiping soot from her eyes, 

happy to be alive. Her dreadlocks 
will hold the smoke for weeks. 

All the white passengers bailed out 
before impact, so certain a sister 

couldn't navigate the crash. O gender. 
O race. O ye of little faith. 

Here we are in the cornfield, bruised and dirty but alive. 
I invite sistergirl pilot home for dinner 

at my parents', for my mother's roast chicken 
with gravy and rice, to celebrate.

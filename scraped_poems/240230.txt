The Department of the Interior and Department of Homeland Security announced a joint enquiry into the explosion and sinking of the Transocean Deepwater Horizon on April 22. The us House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee  on Oversight and Investigations and Senate Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources have also announced investigations.     Last week bp launched its own investigation into the incident and has an investigation team at work in Houston, Texas.

Beneath three thousand feet, the sea is wholly dark.
The shuttle feeds hydraulics to the blind shear ram
and represents a single failure point for disconnect.
Recommendation: Declare selected points on earth
invisible. Affected communities have been provided
with limited quantities of powdered milk
and other staples. Many questions remain. Some
close their eyes under water instinctively.
Imagination can create a sense of peril where
no real peril exists. Safety equipment tests
were necessarily imaginary; mechanisms in question
were wholly inaccessible. A journalist sinking
into the mud was told to toss his camera
to a colleague and hold extremely still. In this
sense, we are our own prisoners. Investigators
have salt in their hair and sand in their teeth.
The hotel pool is empty. Yet questions remain.
Barbeque billboards depict grinning pigs in aprons
and toques. Cleanup crews recover thousands
of plastic milk jugs from the shallows. Do these
images appeal to the death drive? Care should be
taken to ensure the highest possible reliability
from that valve. Thousands in affected communities
have been evicted and live in tents. Demonstrators
have prevented investigators from accessing 
hotel stairwells. 1900: Rudolf Diesel 
demonstrates an engine fueled by peanut oil 
at the Paris World's Fair. The Vietnamese owner 
of Bad Bob's bbq Buffet tells a journalist
she last drank powdered milk in a refugee camp 
“a thousand years ago.” Items available only
in limited quantities are found in Appendix C. 
Cleanup crews have stacked thousands of drums 
of dispersant in hotel parking lots. Dominant 
failure combinations for well control suggest 
additional safety mechanism diversity
and redundancy provide additional reliability. 
Bank of America will offer limited foreclosure 
deferments in affected communities. Thousands 
of years ago, a pronghorn ram slipped beneath 
the surface of a tar pit, jerking its snout
for air. Recommendation: Live at inaccessible 
elevations. Recommendation: Close your eyes. 
Recommendation: Prevent access to the invisible. 
Engineering reports noted required safety 
mechanisms were unlikely to function yet were 
required for safety's sake. If the committee
may offer an analogy, a blind surgeon is dangerous, 
an imaginary surgeon harmless. Still, questions 
remain. BP's 2010 Q1 replacement cost profit 
was $5,598 million, compared with $2,387 million 
a year ago, an increase of 135%. Unlimited 
quantities of peanuts are available. However,
care must be taken to ensure continued high 
reliability of the shuttle valve, since it is 
extremely critical to the overall disconnect 
operation. Phenomena not meant to be accessed 
or imagined are found in Appendix E. Cleanup crews 
are sometimes idled for lack of fuel. 1913: Diesel
found dead, drowned under suspicious circumstances. 
The investigators' hotel toilets won't flush. 
Midas turned everything he touched to gold. 
In this sense, seabirds cloaked in oil are rich.
Cleanup crews live in tents and are provided 
with limited quantities of barbeque and wear 
white canvas jumpsuits like prisoners on furlough. 
If the committee may offer an analogy, the death 
drive resides at wholly dark depths of imagination 
and fuel issues from a wound we've opened there.

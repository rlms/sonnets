I like Rosh Hashonah late, 
when the leaves are half burnt 
umber and scarlet, when sunset 
marks the horizon with slow fire 
and the black silhouettes 
of migrating birds perch 
on the wires davening.

I like Rosh Hashonah late 
when all living are counting 
their days toward death 
or sleep or the putting by 
of what will sustain them— 
when the cold whose tendrils 
translucent as a jellyfish

and with a hidden sting 
just brush our faces 
at twilight. The threat 
of frost, a premonition 
a warning, a whisper 
whose words we cannot 
yet decipher but will.

I repent better in the waning
 season when the blood 
runs swiftly and all creatures
look keenly about them 
for quickening danger. 
Then I study the rockface 
of my life, its granite pitted

and pocked and pickaxed 
eroded, discolored by sun 
and wind and rain— 
my rock emerging 
from the veil of greenery 
to be mapped, to be 
examined, to be judged.

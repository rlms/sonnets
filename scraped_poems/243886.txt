 The earth is dry and they live wanting.
 Each with a small reservoir
 Of furious music heavy in the throat.
 They drag it out and with nails in their feet
 Coax the night into being. Brief believing.
 A skirt shimmering with sequins and lies.
 And in this night that is not night,
 Each word is a wish, each phrase
 A shape their bodies ache to fill—
  
             I'm going to braid my hair
        Braid many colors into my hair
             I'll put a long braid in my hair
        And write your name there
  
 They defy gravity to feel tugged back.
 The clatter, the mad slap of landing.

 And not just them. Not just
 The ramshackle family, the tíos,
 Primitos, not just the bailaor
 Whose heels have notched 
 And hammered time
 So the hours flow in place
 Like a tin river, marking
 Only what once was.
Not just the voices of scraping
 Against the river, nor the hands 
 Nudging them farther, fingers
 Like blind birds, palms empty, 
 Echoing. Not just the women
 With sober faces and flowers
 In their hair, the ones who dance
 As though they're burying
 Memory—one last time— 
 Beneath them.
                         And I hate to do it here.
 To set myself heavily beside them.
 Not now that they've proven
 The body a myth, a parable
 For what not even language
 Moves quickly enough to name.
 If I call it pain, and try to touch it
 With my hands, my own life,
 It lies still and the music thins,
 A pulse felt for through garments. 
 If I lean into the desire it starts from— 
 If I lean unbuttoned into the blow
 Of loss after loss, love tossed
 Into the ecstatic void—
 It carries me with it farther,
 To chords that stretch and bend
 Like light through colored glass.
 But it races on, toward shadows
 Where the world I know
 And the world I fear
 Threaten to meet.

 There is always a road,
 The sea, dark hair, dolor.
  
 Always a question
 Bigger than itself—
  
             They say you're leaving Monday

            Why can't you leave on Tuesday?

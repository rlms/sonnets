Who knows more of gods than I?
Deities defied, not the first time.
I scan scraps of Abraxas,
Rap along to Pac; rip Big's Faith,

My skin infection scratched, an itch
With which I cannot live. I pray
For nightmares — Dana Dane — to stop
Effluvial rainfall. Oh, here comes

The wet stuff. Here come I.
Up the train, off the 7, up
The stairs to Vernon. The church?
St. Mary's. 49th, 49th, 49th.

El ay si mac and cheese. IPA.
A walk across Pulaski Hump to
Greenpoint. It's post-pop
Hipster, so my jeans press

Just one plum to my leg.
The Dionysus to the other,
The Apollo orbiting right, left.
In the middle, Bazooka Joe.

It is, after all, so cold (the plum).
Baller status. Church bells chime,
The chimera within. A right on Driggs,
Parallel to Bedford.

Ratty chains, skulls patch a pylon
Maze of bubblegum dusk.
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant,
The livest one.

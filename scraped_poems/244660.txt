Same size, my parents stained and tore 
alike in the barn, their brown hair

ripe as cow after twelve hours of gutters. 
At supper they spoke in jokey moos.

Sure, showers could dampen that reek 
down to a whiff under fingernails, behind ears,

but no wash could wring the animal from their clothes: 
one pair, two pair, husband, wife, reversible.

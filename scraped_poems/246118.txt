I read the palms of the other 
kids on the field trip to see 
which ones would grow up

to be astronauts. The lifeline 
on Betty Lou's beautiful hand 
ended the day after tomorrow,

so I told her how the rest
of our lives is vastly over-rated, 
even in neighboring galaxies.

When she asked me how I knew 
so much, I said I watched
War of the Worlds six times

and, if she went with me to
the double-feature tomorrow,
I'd finish explaining the universe.

I smiled winningly. The Halley's Comet 
lecture by our teacher whooshed in
my one ear and out the other.

On my birthday

A crow guffaws, dirty man throwing the punch of his 
one joke. And now, nearer, a murder 

answers, chortling from the pale hill's brow. 
From under my lashes' wings they stretch 

clawed feet. There the unflappable years 
perch and stare. When I squint, when I 

grin, my new old face nearly hops 
off my old new face. Considering what's flown, 

what might yet fly, I lean my chin 
on the palm where my half-cashed fortune lies.

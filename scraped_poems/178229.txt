That city will be no more, no halos    
of spring mornings when green hills    
tremble in the midst and rise    
like barrage balloons—    

and May won't cross its streets    
with shrieking birds and summer's promises.    
No breathless spells,    
no chilly ecstasies of spring water.    

Church towers rest on the ocean's floor,    
and flawless views of leafy avenues    
fix no one's eyes.    

And still we live on calmly,    
humbly—from suitcases,    
in waiting rooms, on airplanes, trains,    

and still, stubbornly, blindly, we seek the image,    
the final form of things    
between inexplicable fits    
of mute despair—    

as if vaguely remembering    
something that cannot be recalled,    
as if that submerged city were traveling with us,    
always asking questions,    

and always unhappy with our answers—    
exacting, and perfect in its way.

Release, please, this bound one
      by the power of your right hand.
Receive the song of your people,
      exalt us, Lord, and make us 
pure. Almighty one, protect
      those who seek your oneness:
Bless them and cleanse them—bestow
      upon them your merciful justice.
Mighty one, holy one, in your
      goodness guide your assembly.
Turn, sole one on high,
      to those who remember your sanctity,
and accept our cry and plea— 
      You who fathom all mysteries.

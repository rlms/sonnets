The first time I touched it, 
cloth fell under my fingers, 
the frail white folds 
softened, demure. No burn,

no combustion at the touch of skin. 
It sat, silent, like any other contents 
of any other box: photographs 
of the dead, heirloom jewels.

Exposed to thin windowlight it is 
exactly as in movies: 
a long gown, and where a chest 
must have breathed, a red cross

crossed over. The crown, I know, 
waits underneath, the hood with eyes 
carefully stitched open, arch cap 
like a bishop's, surging to its point.

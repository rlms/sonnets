Back before color threaded 
 the world, when everything 
 was in black-and-white, I was 
 the only pagan at school, hiding 
 my breath with its curry and accent, 
 mouthing words to prayers I didn't 
 understand. I wondered why there 
 were always holy men but so few holy 
 women. I wanted to be enchanted, 
 to steal the baby Jesus from the Christmas 
 play and keep him hidden in my closet, 
 pull him out when I needed to be saved. 
 I wanted to be the blue Madonna holding 
 all the pieces of her son together.

 Half a world away, girls my age came 
 as close to God as anyone could be. 
 They were already throwing their bodies 
 over their husband's funeral pyres, flung 
 out like blankets over the flames, chanting 
 Ram, Ram like a nursery rhyme. My mother 
 told me it was a holy mantra, the more I said 
 it, the holier I would be, but I never really knew 
 how or why, just that it was supposed to happen. 
 Once I tried saying it as many times as I could 
 in fifty seconds, but nothing. No miracle, 
 no halo of thorns around my head. And all I 
 could think about were those girls, widows 
 at fifteen. What did burning flowers smell like? 
 Something terrible, something holy?

No shards
where one is bound to no place in the first place


all shards
we were clear on that from the beginning


Absence is always sudden to hear your voice
once more more


echo than shrapnel qualia of the forbidden

transforms itself into wounds regenerates
a hydra or lizard tail


touch me
I'm alive again


there isn't enough time or proximity
for your essence or mine          to vanish

we'll remain
fire and ice who turn to glass

that doesn't shatter

mercury
if it shatters

we all got tickets to The Truth
finally we thought finally 
when the curtain fell away
our indrawn breaths could be heard
even in the next theater 
even the gasp of the mime 
who had slipped in among us
a loud whushing like reams of litter
whirling upward in a gale
hands shot to mouths and mouths 
fell open I couldn't say within
how many seconds 
all our minds shut some 
slamming others just a click 
like 300 parallel
rows of tipped dominoes  
a racket of almost unison

believe me we wouldn't 
have resisted anything 
but the truth
so instantly and universally
yet we sat there and waited 
for something else
which you could say we also got 
if you count the mime's
unpleasant remark
so she wasn't even a real mime
probably part of what was 
clearly just a performance

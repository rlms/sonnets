A tail, a torso, a tiny face.
A longing, a journey, a deep belief.
A spawning, a fissioning, a bit of tissue
anchored to a psyche, 
stitched to a wish. 
Watery. Irony. Memory. My 
mother, my face, and then

the last thing 
she'd ever see, and then
the last words 
I'd hear her say: You're 
killing me

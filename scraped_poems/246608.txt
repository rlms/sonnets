Long after I married you, I found myself 
in his city and heard him call my name. 
Each of us amazed, we headed to the caf√© 
we used to haunt in our days together. 
We sat by a window across the paneled room 
from the table that had witnessed hours
of our clipped voices and sharp silences. 
Instead of coffee, my old habit in those days, 
I ordered hot chocolate, your drink, 
dark and dense the way you take it, 
without the swirl of frothy cream I like. 
He told me of his troubled marriage, his two 
difficult daughters, their spiteful mother, how 
she'd tricked him and turned into someone 
he didn't really know. I listened and listened, 
glad all over again to be rid of him, and sipped 
the thick, brown sweetness slowly as I could, 
licking my lips, making it last.

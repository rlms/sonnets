Mr. President! The monsoon season is approaching.
This raises the question: What steps are planned
to ensure the timely gathering of the harvest
and to prevent farms from being inundated
along the floodplains of the Amazon river?

Mr. President! I just wanted to express how grateful I am.
Never have I been so proud of my country.
Under your presidency everything's finally been made right.
Allow me just to say a simple, heartfelt thank you.

Mr. President! I have received my veteran's pension.
I am returning it to you, and thank you for your concern.
Where were you, where was your human feeling,
when my fingernails were being torn out?

Mr. President! How long will our schools keep
taking bribes for passing gym class?

Mr. President! I've received a message
that I must deliver to you. I've been ordered to do it.
“Government of  Earth! We, the representatives of the Delta Orion
star system, inform you that if
you do not renounce atomic weaponry
and psychic intervention, we will annihilate you.”

Mr. President! I wish to express my concern.
It seems to me that there isn't enough freedom of speech in our country.
I await your response.

Mr. President! We are two belle ragazze
and we want to have your children! And if that isn't possible,
we want our future men
to be just like you and no one else! Ciao! xoxoxo.

Mr. President! Mikey's cursing again!

Mr. President! How do you patch
KDE2 under FreeBSD?

Mr. President! Yesterday I had a dream.
There was nobody around. The entire planet Earth was empty.
Tell me, can that be done? Or where can I go
to dream that again and so it would never end?

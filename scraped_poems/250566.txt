Where am I 
today?

The dangers, all,
with their appliance,
hickishly gamey,

pitchfork-high
the heavensfallow hoisted,

the losses, chalkmouthed—you
upright mouths, you tables!—
in the disangled town,
harnessed to glimmerhackneys,

—goldtrace, counterheaved
goldtrace!—,

the bridges, overjoyed by the stream,

love, up there in the branch,
niggling at the coming-escaping

the Great Light
elevated to a spark,
on the right of the rings
and all gain.

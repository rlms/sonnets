No longer interested in evil,
the soul turns on its back
at the watering hole, kicks its muscled legs.

Everything goes neon pink
and green in the noonday sun
when I press my thumbs

to my little black eyes. My snout,
wet with its own abundant grease,
smells nothing of threat,

of consequence. I put my hands
behind my head, I have no
bidding to do. My feet go up

on the desk, a woman appears
at my side. This is what I've earned
in Eden. The right to close my eyes

when the camouflage trousers
come wading through
the apple blossom's slough —

and the dream of myself as a baby
emerging from the mortal
body, hoof by gleaming hoof.

God is not light upon light, no more 
than goat is need upon need
although there, where it grazes, it is sun upon coat
 within which ticks and stray-blown feed burrow
 into the pocked skin of such foul scent 
covering the underflesh heart that could eat
 this farmer's grain or the barren mountain's bark
 high in the solitude of sheer animal peace 
laid over sheer animal terror.

We ask the animal afflicted by its time,
its impoverished American meadow
that drove it to find birch from which to strip its easy feed
to abide with us.
It does not need us. We think it needs us.
We must forgive God God's story.

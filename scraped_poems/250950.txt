We are of one mind
and too much has not been said
about all the quiet afternoons 
childhood offered us, 
lit gray like a cat, or blue, 
and cursed with an early moon. 
When father wore an apron 
or crept like a bear, we screamed.
Nothing is so gone. 
Where is his record player 
or the channel that forked 
a distant year toward us,
kind, slow magnet?
There was a song we shared
without your listening, 
you widowed soul crawling away on your elbows.
I sing it to my child, with a full hand I
flick its rapeseeds everywhere,
clear, and slow,
with all the sincerity its author indeed felt
in his ten-gallon hat
and his thin, whisky-soaked shirt.

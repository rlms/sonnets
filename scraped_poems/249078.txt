An envelope arrives unannounced from overseas
 containing stark white sheets,
 
perfect in their presentation of absence.
 Only a bold logo on top
 
revealed its origin, but absolutely nothing else.
 I examined the sheets,
 
peered through their grains —
 heavy cotton-laid striations —
 
concealing text, in white ink, postmarked India.
 Even the watermark's translucence
 
made the script's invisibility transparent.
 Buried among the involute contours, lay sheets
 
of sophisticated pulp, paper containing
 scattered metaphors — uncoded, unadorned,
 
untouched — virgin lines that spill, populate
 and circulate to keep alive its breathings.
 
Corpuscles of a very different kind —
 hieroglyphics, unsolved, but crystal-clear.

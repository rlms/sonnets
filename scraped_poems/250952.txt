The my becomes 

a the, becomes
the state's


the coroner's, 

a law's, something
assignable,


by me, alone, 

though it will not
be the I


I am on 

leaving it, no
longer to be


designated human or 

corpse: cadaver
it will be,


nameless patient 

stored in
the deep hold


of the hospital 

as in the storage
of a ghost ship


run aground —

the secret in it
that will,


perhaps, stir again 

the wind that
failed. It


will be preserved, 

kept like larva,
like a bullet


sealed gleaming 

in its chamber.
They will gather


around it, 

probe and sample,
argue — then


return it 

to its between-
world, remove


their aprons 

and gloves
and stroll, some evenings,


a city block 

for a beer,
a glass of chilled


white wine. Even there, they 

will continue
to speak of it,


what they 

glean from beneath
the narrative


of scars, surgical 

cavities, the
wondrous


mess it became 

before I left it
to them


with what's 

left of me, this
name, a signature,


a neatened 

suture, perfect, this
last, selfish stitch.

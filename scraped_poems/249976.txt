I was someone's
 honor's student once,
 a sticker, a star.
 I aced Home Ec and Geometry;
  
 I learned to stab a fork,
 steer my mother's car.
 Old enough to work,
 I refreshed the salad bar
  
 at Steak & Ale,
 scarcity a line
 I couldn't fail.
 The summers between university,
  
 interned at AT&T,
 in the minority
 outreach they called Inroads.
 My boss, Vicki, had two
  
 roommates, whom she
 called, simply, The Gays,
 crashing on her floor.
 That was before
  
 I was gay, I won't try to say
 with a straight face.
 Like anyone really cares,
 I care. What I'm trying to say:
  
 all this prepared
 me for these squat blinking
 office accessories.
 The dry drinking
  
 after the accidental reply-all.
 By now there's a lot to lose.
 Little by little, I have become
 so careful, no talk
  
 of politics, or orientation:
 I let them say, he's “a homosexual,”
 without an arch correction.
 At a fondue buffet
  
 in Zurich, our dumb-
 founded senior group
 director—when I let slip,
 damn it, my trip
  
 with a twenty-year-old—inquired,
 They're always over seventeen,
 right? I told her of course,
 god yes, and, seething, smiled,
  
 which I'm famous for.
 I didn't want to scare
 her. But I tell you,
 I'm keeping score.
  
 E-mail is no more
 than a suicide
 I'd like to please recall.
 Note my suicide.
  
 I'm paid to multitask,
 scramble the life
 out of fun:
 Monday I will ask—
  
 every dash a loaded gun,
 every comma, a knife—
 you to bury the black-box file.

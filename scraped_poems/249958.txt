For V.S.
When it's Christmas we're all of us magi. 
At the grocers' all slipping and pushing. 
Where a tin of halvah, coffee-flavored,
 is the cause of a human assault-wave 
by a crowd heavy-laden with parcels: 
each one his own king, his own camel.

Nylon bags, carrier bags, paper cones, 
caps and neckties all twisted up sideways. 
Reek of vodka and resin and cod, 
orange mandarins, cinnamon, apples.
 Floods of faces, no sign of a pathway 
toward Bethlehem, shut off by blizzard.

And the bearers of moderate gifts
leap on buses and jam all the doorways,
disappear into courtyards that gape,
though they know that there's nothing inside there:
not a beast, not a crib, nor yet her,
round whose head gleams a nimbus of gold.

Emptiness. But the mere thought of that
brings forth lights as if out of nowhere.
Herod reigns but the stronger he is,
the more sure, the more certain the wonder.
In the constancy of this relation
is the basic mechanics of Christmas.

That's what they celebrate everywhere,
 for its coming push tables together. 
No demand for a star for a while, 
but a sort of good will touched with grace
can be seen in all men from afar,
and the shepherds have kindled their fires.

Snow is falling: not smoking but sounding 
chimney pots on the roof, every face like a stain. 
Herod drinks. Every wife hides her child. 
He who comes is a mystery: features 
are not known beforehand, men's hearts may 
not be quick to distinguish the stranger.

But when drafts through the doorway disperse 
the thick mist of the hours of darkness 
and a shape in a shawl stands revealed,
 both a newborn and Spirit that's Holy 
in your self you discover; you stare 
skyward, and it's right there:
                                                    a star.

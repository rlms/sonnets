there is a plasticity to the soul that can fit inside
sweaters but not inside drawers. how many times
can one watch the same porn video before one
feels that they have become that porn video. how
many times can you attempt to untangle a cross. i
bought a black dress today — long, and covered with
sequins in the timorous shapes of stars. when i paid for it i
imagined myself sitting in it on a curb drinking beer with you,
so tell me what came first, the beer or the dress. you put
my broken buddha lamp in the hall today because it
“just didn't fit.” i put you on the right side of my neck
during a sex dream for the same reason. pisces
is the blue cheese of the zodiac signs. are you a gemini?
rose-covered curtains give me anxiety and black gauze
has the polar-opposite effect. does styrofoam turn you
on? it is narcissistic to assume that anything likes to be liked by
you. it is narcissistic to assume that anything matters if
you don't. i would like to be a man ray photograph
more than i would like to be a person. i would like to
be the glass carnival wallpaper at your lips more than
i would like to be a person. would you fuck me against
your window, even though it is phobic to be naked
in public? i have a feeling that although you are a poet,
you think that poets are phony. i have a feeling that it's
all a joke to you and i like it, but i am not similar.
your lips came to me in a dream, red and shiny like
cartoon wool. your lips came to me in a honda
and i loved them away, and i pushed them anyway.
i wanted to be a porn star, your father wanted you to
make boxes. we both felt upset about the wanting. we both
learned that it is important to feel guiltless about smashing guitars.
i am a 5 p.m. person who buys cardigans to look like
trash. you are a 9 p.m. person who likes both
kinds of nylon against your fingers. i couldn't
concentrate in yoga because i was fixated
on how much you'd like the ass of the
girl in front of me. i'm starting to believe that purple
hair is cliché and i don't like it. i let myself get wet in the
rain today because i wanted you to be proud of me. when are my
poems going to stop you.

this is just the long string of molecules.
this is just the long.

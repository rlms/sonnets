Left the house shattered, it hurt so bad,
so many years as a man, compromise,
in spite of partial success in intellectual tussle

of the late autumn day, barely distinguishable
from early spring, with young willows
and a patch of waste ground where blue jays screamed.

that to nature in its administration
of various cycles—young and old alike—
are inseparably part of a single order—:

so he drank his gin and accepted a dish
of sausage soup, free on Thursdays
with a beverage and so found the Olympian balance
of sorrow and pleasure.

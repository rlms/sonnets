Once we liked the conspicuous
but constrained,

the push-up bra
under the shirt-waist,

a small bow
at the throat,

the appearance
of a struggle

toward the diminutive,
the punctum.



•



The slender
second hand

jerking forward
as if helpless,

making its same sound.



•



We might stand
in a thicket

where a battle had
taken place

and be thrilled
by the far-off roar

of traffic

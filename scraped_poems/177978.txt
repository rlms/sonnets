Thanksgiving, dark of the moon. 
Nothing down here in the underworld but vague shapes and black holes,   
Heaven resplendent but virtual 
Above me, 
                    trees stripped and triple-wired like Irish harps.   
Lights on Pantops and Free Bridge mirror the eastern sky.   
Under the bridge is the river, 
                                                     the red Rivanna. 
Under the river's redemption, it says in the book,   
It says in the book, 
Through water and fire the whole place becomes purified,   
The visible by the visible, the hidden by what is hidden.

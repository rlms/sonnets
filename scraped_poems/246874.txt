If I had enough cages to keep all the birds 
I've collected over the years then I would have 
to open a shop because there's only so much room 
in a two-bedroom walk-up for 48 birds, 
not to mention the dancing bears and the frogs, 
or the different varieties of fish, the one 
species of flea, and I almost forgot the proud 
dogs and the lone mule, the profane one 
who entered my life to curse at scribes and pharisees; 
and maybe he'd let the mouse I found 
forever dying at the end of a poem
ride on his back like a whiskered Christ 
and if not, maybe my yeti could do it 
when he's not downtown working 
security at the store or teaching the parrots 
how to say brotherhood in grunt 
and how to comb out the tangles and mud 
from his hair whose sweat reminds me 
of that bearded collector of  beasts 
with the ark who would have no doubt 
understood how I feel, that prophet 
of change under whose spell I want to confess 
that I'm a Christian of   the Old Testament, 
that my grandfather hung all his goats 
upside down, their throats over a bucket, 
and slapped their chests like that other Nature Boy 
who strutted around the ring 
like a peacock with his feathered hair 
that stayed immaculate 
even on the nights he lost to our hero 
Wahoo McDaniel who never played the heel, 
he who hailed from the lost tribes 
of Oklahoma, who made us want to be chiefs 
so much we wore pigeon feathers 
and circled each other inside a green square 
of water hose until someone finally rang the bell 
that was never there and we sprung 
toward each other like animals in love or at war.

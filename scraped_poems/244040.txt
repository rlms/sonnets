I didn't think handsome then, I thought 
my father the way he saunters down Main Street, 
housewives, shopkeepers, mechanics calling out, 
children running up to get Lifesavers. The way 
he pauses to chat, flipping his lighter open, 
tamping the Lucky Strike on his thumbnail.

I sneak into his den when he's out, tuck 
into the kneehole of his desk and sniff 
his Zippo until dizzy, emboldened; 
then play little tricks, mixing red and black 
inks in his fountain pen, twisting together 
paperclips. If I lift the telephone receiver

quietly, I can listen in on our party line. 
That's how I hear two women 
talking about him. That's why my mother 
finds me that night sleepwalking, sobbing. 
“It's all right,” she tells me,
“you had a nightmare, come to bed.”

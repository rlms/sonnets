Not, this time, to infer
but to wait you out
between regret and parking lot
somewhere in the day 
like a dare

Salt grime and the foodcarts'
rising steam, at Prospect St. a goshawk
huge and aloof, picking at something,
nested in twigs and police tape
for a while we all
held our phones up

It is relentless, the suddenness
of every other 
song, creature, neighbor
as though this life 
would prove you
only by turning into itself

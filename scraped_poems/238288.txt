So when you go wherever it is you will go
take the moon with you 

and make it wear that democratic white shroud,
pocketless, since rich and poor, 

we take nothing with us, save a small stick or dowel
in the casket, so we can all

burrow through the earth to the Holy Land
when the time is right.

Please forgive that I confessed your amusement 
at Shakespeare's “mewling and puking”

in my eulogy.

All summer, the city engine's low 
roar capsizes our bodies into sleep, 
groans,
                evacuation—
                                                   Lost to a watery 
anamnesis so warm it requires a raft 
thatched from death's
                                         flotsam to necklace its shore

                              I swim on, calling your name

In my dreams, something is always deserting

But tonight, no fast shadows of birds
No oceanic flowers disrobing butterflies
or bright beach of child's porridge and bones—

                                                                                 Instead, someone weaving

a net from fallen hair in and around our bed 
to catch the breath, blood, and ritual 
motions that oiled us
                                            as one candle in a cave

In your dreams, someone is always resisting being saved

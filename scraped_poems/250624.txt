When I spoke the words I am gay
I had let them fester like blood on a prison cell wall.
I hadn't known that they would free themselves.

They scaled the swollen gutter of my throat, and shot
themselves right through Uncle Andy's
diaphragm, holding the air in lungs hostage so he
had no words left of his own. He could only unfurl his
vinegar lips to sputter silent thank yous across my brow.

I kissed the darkness three times, because it stole
those three merciless words from me
before my Mother could.

She told me that I would never
survive a New York winter:

Mother, painted face and gossamer cheeks. It wasn't you
walking down the hall to Economics, when you heard
a familiar voice, a voice that told jokes you always
laughed at in class, and he said: I can
tolerate faggots,
but if they flirt with me, I wouldn't
hesitate
to beat them down.

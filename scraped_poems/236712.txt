Love cities, this is what my brother taught me
as he cut soldiers' hair, then tidied tomatoes 

watching Sonya and I dance on a soapy floorâ€”
I open the window, say in a low voice, my brother.

The voice I do not hear when I speak to myself is the clearest voice.
But the sky was all around us once.

We played chess with empty matchboxes,
he wrote love letters to my wife

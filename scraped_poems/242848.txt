CNN says the rehab here is good, so the film crew has come in.They thank him for his service. They tell him he's a credit to his country, to all of us,all our brave young women and men. They ask if he has any hobbies, if he can tell uswhat he'd most want to do that he used to enjoy doing. He says he'd like to walk again.I hate everyone, all of us who have sent him into flames. I hate the film crew, hate CNN, the rehab facility, every tube that goes in and out of him, every monitor that beeps, even the morphine feed that drips and seeps. They ask him if it is frustrating and he weeps.

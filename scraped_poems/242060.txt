It's as if she were an earn,
                                                                   gebidende prey for her eyrie.

Perched alertly,
                                                                   ﻿a hægtesse on their innards.

In bitter morgenceald,
                                                                   ﻿her hoar-glittered feathers.

Suddenly she sees
                                                                   ﻿a fox on the westene.

At that she rouses,
                                                                   ﻿heaved up on high,

and heads straight at him,
                                                                   ﻿in harrowing hæste.

Hearing her, he freezes
                                                                   ﻿his tail. He's terrified.

Sees, bestelð,
                                                                   ﻿with ēagan flashing,

talons overtake him,
                                                                   ﻿﻿dash him down in torment,

overtake him again,
                                                                   ﻿﻿swengeð him on the eorðan.

One yelp as she pincers his liver.
                                                                   ﻿﻿Wyrd—pierces aorta.

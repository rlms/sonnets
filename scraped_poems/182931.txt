for my mother
the living  

    1. 
After Independence Day 
all our toys began to tear 
up, school growing sweet 

on our tongues. We had 
already cut & hoed 
the cotton into rows, weeds 

piled useless as Confederate 
bills. September meant picking 
& half-days at Springfield, us colored 

grades let off at noon to pick 
the valuable white till 
nightfall. My hands, civil 

& slow, didn't even deserve 
my behind on the picking truck, 
but Unc Chock ran the thing 

& Mama would've killed him dead 
if he'd dreamt of trying 
to get salty. The money was bad 

like all money then, not near 
as green or wide. Three dollars 
for a hundred pounds, better part 

of a day. I barely kept up, hands swole up 
like unpicked fruit. No matter when 
she started, Frankie plucked fifteen pounds 

more, food for two, a new 
Easter dress. Summers I turned 
so black & bent, all because I'd rather 

pick with friends than sling weeds 
alone, than stuff my mattress green. 


    2. 
Winters, when the white king 
had gone, we slept like fish, still 
moving. We walked back home 
for lunch & retraced after school, changing 
into our other pair of drawers 
before we chored the stove's ash. No one 

got gas till after the War. Each November 
brought a boxcar from the Atchison 
Topeka & Santa Fe; for a share, 
Lopez balanced it home on his flatbed, 
a whale from the hunt. Once full 
of hobos, that bell we burnt kept us 

from freezing all season long. Before 
tossing each board in, I would run 
my hands across the wood speech 
of burns, carvings warning 
Unfriendly Conductor, Town of No 
Sleep. Leftover wood turned 

to toys; three boards & somebody's 
old rollerskate became a summer 
scooter. Bored, what was that? 
We were too busy being poor 
in that house air-conditioned all winter, 
too busy sharing everything, even 

bathwater evenings by the pipe stove. 
No plumbing, no rats, only mice thick 
enough to believe we had more 
than they did.

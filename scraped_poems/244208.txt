A Schwinn-ride away: Eagledale Plaza. Shopping strip of busted 
walkways, crooked parking spaces nicked like the lines 
on the sides of somebody's mom-barbered head. Anchored 
by the Piccadilly disco, where a shootout was guaranteed every 
weekend, those gun claps: coughing stars shot from sideways
guns shiny enough to light the way for anyone willing to keep 
a head up long enough to see. Not me. I bought the Star Map 
Shirt for 15Â¢ at the Value Village next to the Piccadilly during
the daytime. The shirt was polyester with flyaway collars, 
outlined in the forgotten astronomies of disco. The shirt's 
washed-out points of light: arranged in horse & hero shapes 
 & I rocked it in places neither horse nor hero hung out. 
Polyester is made from polyethylene & catches fire easily 
like wings near a thrift store sun. Polyethylene, used in shampoo 
bottles, gun cases, & those grocery sacks skidding like upended 
stars across the parking lot. There are more kinds of stars 
in this universe than salt granules on drive-thru fries. Too many 
stars, lessening & swelling with each pedal pump away from 
the Value Village as the electric billboard above flashes first 
one dui attorney, then another who speaks Spanish so the sky 
above is constantly chattering, like the biggest disco ball ever.

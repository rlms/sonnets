the poets have always preceded,
as Mallarmé preceded Cézanne,
neck and neck    that was no
privilege, sweet and forgotten

seated in chairs, the afternoon
marches along with the shadows
which are not bougainvillaea but
northern    I have always loved

shadows as long as they were northern
and moved gently west    like the
crack-up of books, their spines
tingling with notes and stuffing

most people remember the gardens
with cement flowers and the
house going straight up like
solidified swimming-pools or lilies

when you get to the top which
they once called widow's walk,
you wait in nothing but your garden
hat, beautifully otherwise naked

for the wind-swept sea and the dying
sweetness or womb, declaring the completion
of philosophy

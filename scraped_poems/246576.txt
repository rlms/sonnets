Our loneliness sits with us at dinner, an unwanted guest 
who never says anything. It's uncomfortable. Still

we get to know each other, like students allowed 
to use a private research library for only one night.

I go through her file of friends, cities and jobs. 
“What was that like?” I ask. “What did you do then?”

We are each doctors who have only ourselves 
for medicine, and long to prescribe it for what ails

the other. She has a nice smile. Maybe, maybe . . . 
I tell myself. But my heart is a cynical hermit

who frowns once, then shuts the door of his room 
and starts reading a book. All I can do now is want

to want her. Our polite conversation coasts 
like a car running on fumes, and then rolls to a stop;

we split the bill, and that third guest at the table 
goes home with each of us, to talk and talk.

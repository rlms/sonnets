For my father
I think by now the river must be thick 
        with salmon. Late August, I imagine it

as it was that morning: drizzle needling 
         the surface, mist at the banks like a net

 settling around us — everything damp 
         and shining. That morning, awkward

 and heavy in our hip waders, we stalked 
         into the current and found our places —

 you upstream a few yards and out
         far deeper. You must remember how

 the river seeped in over your boots
         and you grew heavier with that defeat.

 All day I kept turning to watch you, how 
         first you mimed our guide's casting

 then cast your invisible line, slicing the sky 
         between us; and later, rod in hand, how

 you tried — again and again — to find 
         that perfect arc, flight of an insect

 skimming the river's surface. Perhaps 
         you recall I cast my line and reeled in

 two small trout we could not keep.
         Because I had to release them, I confess,

 I thought about the past — working 
         the hooks loose, the fish writhing

 in my hands, each one slipping away
         before I could let go. I can tell you now

 that I tried to take it all in, record it 
         for an elegy I'd write — one day — 

 when the time came. Your daughter,
         I was that ruthless. What does it matter

 if I tell you I learned to be? You kept casting 
         your line, and when it did not come back

 empty, it was tangled with mine. Some nights, 
         dreaming, I step again into the small boat

 that carried us out and watch the bank receding — 
         my back to where I know we are headed.

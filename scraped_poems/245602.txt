Fireplace blocked,
sealed with
cardboard, and taped.
Furniture trashed,
paneling smashed.
On the second floor

mid-corridor, 
a rotting cat
furry and fey
in a nap 
of â€Šgore 
glued flat

to a spot
on the floor, 
ether-sweet 
in a frieze of decay,
up-staring, popeyed,
pissed.

The screens I installed
belled out, belled in.
Every window
cracked, broken,
or forgotten, left open. 
The in-gusting Atlantic 

left smelling sick. 
A shade softly crashed
on a sash,
 finish nails and a bare
 molly bolt fanfared
me from the gloom.

Google the address:
from outer space 
it's a bare green blot, 
treeless, erased,
terns where we made love,
gulls where we fought.

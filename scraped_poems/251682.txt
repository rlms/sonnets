As I drove into town
 the driver in front of me 
runs a stop sign. 
A pedestrian pulls down his cap. 
A man comes out of his house 
to sweep the steps.
 Ordinariness
 bright as raspberries. 

I turn on the radio. 
Somebody tells me
 the day is sunny and warm. 
A woman laughs 

and my daughter steps out of the radio. 
Grief spreads in my throat like strep. 
I had forgotten, I was happy, I maybe 
was humming "You Are My Lucky Star," 
a song I may have invented. 
Sometimes a red geranium, a dog,
 a stone
will carry me away. 
But not for long. 
Some memory or another of her 
catches up with me and stands
 like an old nun behind a desk, 
ruler in hand.

My route lassos the outskirts, 
the reclusive, the elderly, the ruralâ€” 
the poor who clan in their tarpaper 
islands, the old ginseng hunter

 Albert Harm, who strings the "crow's
 foot" to dry over his wood stove. 
Shy eyes of fenced-in horses 
follow me down the rutted dirt road. 

At dusk, I pedal past white birches, 
breathe the smoke of spring chimneys, 
my heart working uphill toward someone 
hungry for word from the world. 

I am Mercury, bearing news, my wings
 a single-speed maroon Schwinn bike.
 I sear my bright path through the twilight 
to the sick, the housebound, the lonely. 

Messages delivered, wire basket empty, 
I part the blue darkness toward supper, 
confident I've earned this day's appetite, 
stronger knowing I'll be needed tomorrow.

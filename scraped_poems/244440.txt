Three mini ciabattini for breakfast
where demand for persnickety bread
is small, hence its expense, hence my steadfast

who ground gems on ham for her guests; 
the queen who ground out two cups of flour 
on the pregnant abdomen of her husband's mistress;

I think of a “great rock-eating bird” 
grinding out a sandy beach, 
the foam said to be particulate matter 
of minute crustaceans, each

brilliantly spooning up Aphrodite 
to Greek porticoes, and our potatoes,
and plain living which might be
shaken by infinitesimal tattoos.

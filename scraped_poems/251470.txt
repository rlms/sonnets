He laughed with a laugh
 that he wished was his laugh,
 but everyone knew it wasn't.
  
 When he laughed he would ask,
"Does that sound like my laugh?"
 and everyone said, "It doesn't."
  
 The laugh that he laughed
 that wasn't his laugh went
"Hardy har har, guffaw!"

 The laugh that he laughed
 that he wished wasn't his went,
"Hruck, sniffle-hick, hee-haw!"

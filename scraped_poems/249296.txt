Hoarfrost coats and cuffs 
the playing fields, a heyday 
of glistening. So there's hope 
in my throat as I walk across them 
to the woods with my chest 
flung open, spilling its coins. 
The light so bright I can hear it, 
a silver tone like a penny whistle.

It's fall, so I'm craving pine cones. 
Hundreds of maples the color 
of bulldozers!
             
          But something strange 
is going on: the trees are tired 
of meaning, sick of providing 
mystery, parallels, consolation. 
“Leave us alone,” they seem to cry, 
with barely energy for a pun.

The muscular river crawls on 
its belly in a maple coat of mail. 
Muddy and unreflective, it smells 
as if it too could use some privacy.

The sumac reddens like a face, 
holding out its velvet pods 
almost desperately. The Queen 
Anne's Lace clicks in the wind.

A deaf-mute milkweed 
foaming at the mouth.

Back at the field I look 
for what I didn't mean 
to drop. The grass is green.

                            Okay, Day, 
my host, I want to get out 
of your house. Come on, Night, 
with your twinkly stars and big 
dumb moon. Tell me don't 
show me, and wipe that grin 
off your face.

Not seeing me, not even looking, 
K. on her silver cruiser charms her way

through the last long moment 
of   the changing light: 

snow boots and a Seychelles Warbler's 
old blue tights,

a rolled-up yoga mat in her basket
wobbling like a wild tiller as she pedals. 

It feels illicit and somewhat right 
to stand across the intersection 

without shouting 
her name, or even waving.

According to the internet
tutorial, the fact that photons 

turn into tiny loyal billiard balls
as soon as we start watching suggests

no error of method 
or measurement, but rather, 

as far as anyone can tell, 
an invisibly unstable world, 

a shaking everywhere 
that seeing must pin down and fix.

So, that morning I stumbled on you
out, alone, bending through

the traffic at Orange and Edwards Streets:
a someone else then 

whom I, alone, 
can never otherwise see —

there has to be a kind of   speech
beyond naming, or even praise,

a discipline 
that locates light and lets it go.

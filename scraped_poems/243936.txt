Time to give up
grieving my mother's loss,
faulting my father and 
his Neolithic moral certitude 
about every detail
on the evening news,
his general absence
hanging like the gray 
sheets on the line.

Never mind how 
mismatched in the heart,
I should be grateful 
they were there at all, 
for that moment 
that childhood stretched 
like fog, the beach empty
and unmarked.

It comes to little now
who I forgive, mourn, 
or thank. The dust shifts 
and we are barely 
suspended in the light. 

I know this little thing:
there's a boy somewhere 
in a station where 
the trains still run,
wearing scuffed brown shoes, 
gray overcoat, and cap;
someone has neatly parted
and combed his hair. 
He is waiting 
to be taken by the hand
and told where we are going, 
to hear we are headed homeâ€” 
though I can see nothing 
beyond the smoke 
and midnight haze 
at the far end 
of the platform, 
where I am not
even sure of the stars.

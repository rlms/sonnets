In the early afternoon my mother
 was doing the dishes. I climbed
 onto the kitchen table, I suppose
 to play, and fell asleep there.
 I was drowsy and awake, though,
 as she lifted me up, carried me
 on her arms into the living room,
 and placed me on the davenport,
 but I pretended to be asleep
 the whole time, enjoying the luxuryâ€”
 I was too big for such a privilege
 and just old enough to form
 my only memory of her carrying me.
 She's still moving me to a softer place.

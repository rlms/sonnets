the Venetian blinds 
I dusted off

for my mother on 
Saturday mornings,

closing, opening them 
with the pull cord a few

times just to watch the outside 
universe keep blinking,

as the flock suddenly 
rises from November stubble,

hovers a few seconds, 
closing, opening,

blinking, before it tilts, 
then vanishes over a hill.

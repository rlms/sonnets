The birdless place
 the Greeks named it.

Insufflation of you know what.

Followed quickly by some drone, 
some doctor, now that you mention it,

bearing the proverbial cup 
on a silver filigree stem.

I'll try a drop of that.

The hoarse divinities would parade
 before the inventor of butterfly wings.

No subtext here, 
people are naked.

Bartering with the guileless do I 
even want to know?

Three little ghostesses 
Sitting on postesses 
Eating buttered toastesses 
Greasing their fistesses 
Up to their wristesses.

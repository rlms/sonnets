It would never be possible for a stone, no more than for an airplane, to elevate itself toward the sun in jubilation.                                                       — Martin Heidegger
The dragonflies again; the last time seeing them 
skim the river close
                                    to forgotten — their singing, 
their shimmer — now remembered, becoming so much 
flame; 
            as tongues over the heads of the chosen in the child's picture 
book of Christ I learned by heart, descent and weight of after 
the fact, the gift 
                             the fork 
between hope and vanity, the river that eats
itself  turned mirror broken into 
                                                           light; the corpse 
between the beloved's good word 
and the beloved 
                              who having spoken was ever spoken
into being, lies, unspeaking, and as with any heaviness that lowers
then hovers, remains 
                              inconceivable; so the letter given in stone, perfection 
in fire;
love; all
               love's failures; the winged animal
drops to the earth and is there buried in a hole where it digs 
in the grit like the blade 
                                            we left in the riverbed, adrift and cry-
shaped in the memory, both 
that dim and that loud; though 
                                                         no accosting why it
seems that way, everything ghost 
of itself or everything made 
                                                  of mythic proportion, the walker
sinking from the face of the waters, the dragon I
become when I talk to myself, what a belief
                                                                             is, terrifying
and relentless; I've never been 
able to tell the difference;
                                              the brute and the apparition
in reflection speak at once — the rock and the rock's light — 
so that now the insect thrums 
                                                      and it is surely
a kind of tenderness, an ODing in secret, turning into while turning
from the soul the animal raised
                                                        and devoured in dream; imagine, 
the child's wished-for surface gives and ripples up 
                                                                                           to mouth
the perfect imprint, saying “aircraft” and there are aircraft, amen,
the walker is surrounded by flight on all sides; 
                                                                                    the walker 
walks without wings; see,

the recollection is flawless, turning wings of  jewels; 
the recollection is absolute, swallows whole; 

                                                                                 echoes;

and the dragon feasts; and the dragon flies again;

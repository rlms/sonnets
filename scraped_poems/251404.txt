You would expect an uncountable number,
Acres and acres of books in rows 
Like wheat or gold bullion. Or that the words just
Appear in the mind, like banner headlines. 
In fact there is one shelf 
Holding a modest number, ten or twelve volumes.
No dust jackets, because — no dust. 
Covers made of gold or skin 
Or golden skin, or creosote or rain-
Soaked macadam, or some 
Mix of salt & glass. You turn a page 
& mountains rise, clouds drawn by children 
Bubble in the sky, you are twenty
Again, trying to read a map
Dissolving in your hands. I say You & mean 
Me, say God & mean Librarian — who after long research
Offers you a glass of water and an apple — 
You, grateful to discover your name,
A footnote in that book.

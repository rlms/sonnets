"Was Andalusia here or there? On the land . . . or in the poem?"                                                                               —Mahmoud Darwish

I must admit to this outright theft.
 Before the crickets could impede me,

I reached outside my window
 to grab as much of Andalusia as

I could in the palm of my hand.
 I took the evening's silver

from the olive trees, the yellow slumber
 from the lemons, the recipe for gazpacho.

I made a small incision in my heart 
and slipped in as much as my left

and right ventricles could hold.
I reached for a pen and a piece of paper

to ease-out the land into this poem. 
I closed the small incision in my heart

and closed the wooden shutters 
of my window.

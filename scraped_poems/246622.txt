You can't have nothing clean. 
I scrubbed like a crazy woman 
at Isom's clothes that first week 
and here they come off the line, little black 
stripes wherever I'd pinned them up 
or hung them overâ€”coal dust settles 
on the clothesline, piles up 
like a line of snow on a tree branch. 
After that, I wiped down the clothesline 
every time, but no matter, you can't 
get it all off. His coveralls is stripy 
with black and gray lines, 
ankles of his pants is ringed around,
 like marks left by shackles. 
I thought I'd die that first week 
when I seen him walk off to the mine, 
black, burnt-looking marks 
on his shirt over his shoulders, right 
where wings would of folded.

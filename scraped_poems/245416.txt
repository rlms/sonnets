There are fewer introductions
In plague years,
Hands held back, jocularity
No longer bellicose,
Even among men. 
Breathing's generally wary,
Labored, as they say, when
The end is at hand.
But this is the everyday intake
Of   the imperceptible life force,
Willed now, slow —
Well, just cautious
In inhabited air.
As for ongoing dialogue,
No longer an exuberant plosive
To make a point,
But a new squirreling of air space,
A new sense of   boundary.
Genghis Khan said the hand
Is the first thing one man gives
To another. Not in this war.
A gesture of   limited distance
Now suffices, a nod,
A minor smile or a hand
Slightly raised,
Not in search of   its counterpart,
Just a warning within
The acknowledgment to stand back.
Each beautiful stranger a barbarian
Breathing on the other side of the gate.

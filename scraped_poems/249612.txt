But inside her, there is always velvet, 
velvet with its give and yield, the kind you 
find at a pet store, a bin full of long 
ears and noses busy snuffing up nerves 
among the cedar chips and their eyes 
opening wide as if rabbits couldn't know 
what softness brings, as if they'd never know 

the smell of something long stored away now 
brought into light, and now too her mother 
with a camera pointing at her, red 
child on the lap of the Easter rabbit, 
softness of the body hiding inside 
the costume, eyes glinting from the wide holes
 in the mask, not a single sobbing breath 

of wind down the trail of mesquite and broom
 foot-printing the hills of some rancher's land. 
The bird dog lifts his ears to the sound 
of velvet, the girl listens to the drawn
 cries of a crow, her father walks
 with the silence of the shotgun, waiting
 for the pointer to find scent, the rabbit 
at the end of it blinking, its wide eyes 
shrinking from the scuffle of their feet like

 velvet settling, laid over lines, drying 
across the ceiling of an uncle's garage 
where they talk inside the smell of salted 
skin. At least three dollars for each good pelt 
he says, and they scream like children when, 
sleeves rolled over his forearms, he brings
 the club down on their heads, saving 
their feet for cheap key chains, for luck 

that softness doesn't seem to have inside 
of cages, chicken wire, tubes of water, 
and sometimes boys who try kicking the cage 
around to see what happens to velvet 
tumbling. And, in the after quiet,
 she bites the hands reaching toward her, so they 
stone her, they open her belly and pull 
some things out, open the pink albino
 eye and groan at the fluid inside. Then they 
bury the carcass without thinking first 
of washing their sticky hands in the sink

 before eating dinner, before setting 
the table, in the still softness of her 
beige room, she sits on the carpet picking 
at the velveteen of Bunny's stuffed neck, 
the rabbit's eyes dull with scratches, eyes left 
behind on her bed at night when she stands
 in the hall, hearing her father breathe in his room

in the darkness, on the futon, kicking 
off the sheets. Awake from a fluid dream 
of a woman's eyes staring from behind 
a gag, her white skin settling in fat pools 
around her, naked, bald. And a man's 
voice said, this is your rabbit, so she woke
 to this dream inside her, with his teeth wrapped 
in her hair, and his hands inside her thighs 
where he fingered her coldly. But it has 
always been like thisâ€”wild, insidious, 
and commanding because she gives to it, 
fascinated by it and caught by it,
 as velvet only listens and is quiet.

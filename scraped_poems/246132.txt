Nose tucked under tail,
you are a warm, furred planet 
centered in my bed.
All night I orbit, tangle-limbed,
in the slim space
allotted to me.

If I accidentally
bump you from sleep,
you shift, groan,
drape your chin on my hip.

O, that languid, movie-star drape!
I can never resist it.
Digging my fingers into your fur, 
kneading,
      I wonder: 
How do you dream?
What do you adore?
Why should your black silk ears 
feel like happiness?

This is how it is with love.
Once invited,
it steps in gently,
circles twice,
and takes up as much space 
as you will give it.

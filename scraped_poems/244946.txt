Out the barred window sandbags 
in a sagging wall surround the guard post 
where a soldier half-hidden by the flag 
holds his rifle on his knees and looks a little lost. 

It's Sunday and quiet, the traffic noise 
off aways, the sea behind the post flat as the tarps 
pulled tight over the troop trucks. 
Somewhere down the hall soldiers are being boys, 

telling some joke in Arabic 
in which I'm pretty sure I hear the word “zubrak”: 
I walk between shelves loaded with canned rations, 

the cool expiring slowly in the high-ceilinged room
while a pinned-up PSYOPS leaflet declares,
If you sleep in a cemetery, you're bound to have nightmares.

No one sees the doll's decapitated head small 
and neat in rubble. Never tired or sleepy, 
the head is its own country 
obstinately surviving, the pupil 

of   its one eye peering through the glass's pure 
transparency. And a few feet away lie its slim, plastic, 
long-legged thighs almost like 
an obscenity the eye watches over —

no one in the street, nothing but bolt-marks
from tank-treads scarring the concrete 
to give any of   it drama — and what 

about the way the lips' frozen smirk 
keeps daring me to touch the sexless V 
between the thighs staring up at me?

The barracks dissolve into a reef   of   rubble in the fog.
On either side of the road, crater after crater
flashes with glints of glass, plastic bags,
a chair leg clinging to a dismembered chair. 

The TV station, the power stacks 
thrusting up through mist, the black-bearded posters
and banners strung across 
the streets lead to an absolute nowhere:

all that's left in the emptied town 
after the army pulled out are PSYOPS leaflets 
fluttering up around the car that winds 

down the coast road deeper into mist, headlights
probing like instruments in a wound
they illuminate the more they violate.

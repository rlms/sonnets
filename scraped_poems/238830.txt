How dumb he was to wipe the blood from his eye
where he was sucker-punched and stagger out
onto the Plaza blind. He had been waiting
all night for the acorn moon and eating pineapple
topping over his ice cream and arguing
either physics or philosophy. He thinks,
at this late date, it was the cave again
throwing a shadow, although it may have been
only some way of reconciling the two 
oblivious worlds, which was his mission anyhowâ€”
if only there was a second moon. He had a 
kind of beard and though he could practically lift
the front end of a car and was already
reading Blake, he had never yet tasted honey.

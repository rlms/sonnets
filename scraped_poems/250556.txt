with clear-cased woofers for heads, 
no eyes. They see us as a bat sees 
a mosquito—a fleshy echo, 
a morsel of sound. You've heard
 their intergalactic tour busses 
purring at our stratosphere's curb. 
They await counterintelligence
 transmissions from our laptops 
and our blue teeth, await word 
of humanity's critical mass, 
our ripening. How many times 
have we dreamed it this way: 
the Age of the Machines, 
postindustrial terrors whose 
tempered paws—five welded fingers 
—wrench back our roofs, 
siderophilic tongues seeking blood, 
licking the crumbs of us from our beds. 
O, great nation, it won't be pretty.
 What land will we now barter 
for our lives ? A treaty inked
 in advance of the metal ones' footfall. 
Give them Gary. Give them Detroit, 
Pittsburgh, Braddock—those forgotten 
nurseries of girders and axels. 
Tell the machines we honor their dead, 
distant cousins. Tell them 
we tendered those cities to repose
out of respect for welded steel's 
bygone era. Tell them Ford 
and Carnegie were giant men, that war 
glazed their palms with gold. 
Tell them we soft beings mourn 
manufacture's death as our own.

Roy Halston Frowick, 1932–1990
He kept his middle name, the pick of   the lot, 
he thought, and mispronounced himself: Hall-stun. 

At Bergdorf's he acquired an accent and referred 
to himself   in the third person, every bird he flayed 

wrapped in Ultrasuede. He lit a True with a True, 
smeared his hirsute muse with sequins. There were air- 

kisses, Capote's new-cut face at Studio 54, that Baccarat 
flute of ejaculate. Never too late, he ordered in 

meat and potatoes, and a trick. 
He called it “dial-a-steak, dial-a-dick.” He appeared 

on The Love Boat, Halstonettes in tow, 
maybe the high, maybe the low, watermark. 

When his pupils betrayed him at work, on came the shades. 
And a well-cut blazer, paranoia. He had signed away 

the rights to his name, for options. When he tried 
to reclaim them from the conglomerate, 

he excused himself to the toilet, just a sec — 
white dust on a black turtleneck. 

His block started to look a lot like sickness. 
Even his beloved orchids, the sickness. 

Just like that, the eighties were gone. 
New York, New York, the eighties were no one.

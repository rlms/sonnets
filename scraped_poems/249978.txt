A chimney, breathing a little smoke.
 The sun, I can't see
 making a bit of pink
 I can't quite see in the blue.
 The pink of five tulips
 at five p.m. on the day before March first.
 The green of the tulip stems and leaves
 like something I can't remember,
 finding a jack-in-the-pulpit
 a long time ago and far away.
 Why it was December then
 and the sun was on the sea
 by the temples we'd gone to see.
 One green wave moved in the violet sea
 like the UN Building on big evenings,
 green and wet
 while the sky turns violet.
 A few almond trees
 had a few flowers, like a few snowflakes
 out of the blue looking pink in the light.
 A gray hush
 in which the boxy trucks roll up Second Avenue
 into the sky. They're just 
 going over the hill.
 The green leaves of the tulips on my desk
 like grass light on flesh,
 and a green-copper steeple
 and streaks of cloud beginning to glow.
 I can't get over
 how it all works in together
 like a woman who just came to her window
 and stands there filling it
 jogging her baby in her arms.
 She's so far off. Is it the light
 that makes the baby pink?
 I can see the little fists
 and the rocking-horse motion of her breasts.
 It's getting grayer and gold and chilly.
 Two dog-size lions face each other
 at the corners of a roof.
 It's the yellow dust inside the tulips.
 It's the shape of a tulip.
 It's the water in the drinking glass the tulips are in.
 It's a day like any other.

By new names
and then no names
at all, their laws
will reach your land,

Lorine, to feed
on your much loved
marshy spaces
whose occasional faces

discern a stranger
from far off
but like to take
a break from well

or welding just
to talk. We can-
not extricate
a place from those

it's made of, the sounds 
it makes. But now
from Blackhawk
Island to Madison

to Washington,
geologies
thin; more things 
sound or work

the same. Their laws 
will reach your land, 
Lorine, by new names
then no names at all.

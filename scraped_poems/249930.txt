—for the members of Oshugó Àgàn
At first a child
rolled off a reed mat
a height of no consequence
Later the bald ageless vulture
circles the hill the man climbs

When the owners of the land arrived 
they brought beaded bag in their search 
Bag beaded big enough to house the echoes 
that gave birth to sketches of words on dust 
Bag deep enough to circle obstacles 
that would sprout upon birth

They reached a clean house chalked walls
of peace a person of peace
They planted a pair of brass scepters
illumined male / female
short legs kneeling long torso crisscrossed
by arms
hands
clenching some secret
or just its thumbs

They saw three to be balanced— 
               Earth & us
               Impermanence & love 
               water & its gourd as gorge
               fish & whirling water

How they all seemed dependent on each other 
There is balance where there are three . . .

The snow voids the distance of the road
and the first breath comes from the early morning
ghosts. The sparrows with their hard eyes
glisten in the difficult light. They preen
their feathers and chirp. It's as though they were one
voice talking to God.
                                    Mornings are a sustained hymn 
without the precision of faith. You've turned the bag 
filled with molding bread inside out and watch 
the old crusts fall to the ice. What's left 
but to watch the daylight halved by the glistening ground? 
What's left but an empty bag and the dust of bread 
ravaged by songsters?
                                       There are ruins we witness 
within the moment of the world's first awakening 
and the birds love you within that moment. They want 
to eat the air and the stars they've hungered for, little razors.

Little urgent bells, the birds steal from each other's mouths 
which makes you hurt. Don't ask for more bread. 
The world is in haste to waken. Don't ask for a name 
you can surrender, for there are more ghosts to placate. 
Don't hurt for the sparrows, for they love you like a road.

But you made every
delicate, elegant wrist
& glistening ankle.
But you made them
beautiful
in braided rope
& dime store gold. 
But you made every
necklace clasp.
But you made them
caress the nape
like an errant wind
after a shower. 
But you made every
eyelash erotic. Every
single strand of hair
soft.
But you made them
from dust & bone.
Made every glorious 
singing thigh. Every
button nose.
But you made them
with holesâ€”
wide open
to the faintest hints
of salt
in a sea breeze, salt
in the sweaty mouth
of a navel, salt
in the blood, sweet
in every wrong way.

got up early
 left the house immediately
 tore out grass
 bits of leather in his pockets
 hit fences with his handkerchief
 answered yes and no
 to his own questions
  
 lies under grass
 wilted flowers in his pockets
 at the fence I pull my handkerchief
 he liked to say no
 “I'm no longer the same man”
 and 
  
 “nothing is happening to me”

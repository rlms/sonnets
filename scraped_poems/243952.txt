These, his last, 
                          employers, dead
Inexplicably and
Unavailable 
              to praise his diligence, 

Cast a shadow on his prospects, and he sighed. 
Before all this, he 
Would have lit a pipe and 
                          mused on the past 
In aromatic mauve tobacco...Shadows 
Baffled pleasantly 
              the better rug 

Once a bear. 
                          Grizzly bear. 
He would have enjoyed a smoke with a bear. 
Hibernation is 
              not unlike a job you fail to love. 

He would have enjoyed 
Some banter on, and amiable disputation of, 
His claim. Or
                          on job loss, in general; 
On night air, the fanfare above a curve, a star,
If suitably 
              asparkle in public.

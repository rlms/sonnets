Forget about

it for you'll
never win,

never hit the jackpot,

move in
to a solar-powered eco mansion

and modest

philanthropy,
become a panjandrum

of diaphanous pleasures

but must sink
or swim

beneath mood-

mutable skies, coconut
milk clouds,

in the shadow of high flats,

low sales, bright fronts,
strung crowds

of literally miraculous

people in
expensive skin

like bed sheets

you would wrap yourself in
and which you now touch

lightly as you enter

this café
past a clutch

of mitching schoolgirls

with pierced noses
and Tintin

hairdos who look

at you as if to say
is it dial-a-dickhead

day in here?

or maybe that's aimed instead
at the guy eating flatbread

with five thousand

friends on his phone
who types with a grin


all is well with the world,
when all is not well with the world — 


the burden of debt

as your granny might say
heavy as sin — 

although who would begrudge

this incense
of crushed coffee in steam

this clatter and chatter

latex flowers under halogen lights
and who'd demean

that woman

with her small child wiping
the small child's chin

to the delight of a lonely

well-off older person
or w.o.o.p. — 

I believe they call them

woopies — at the next
table over who scoops

two shaking spoons

of sugar into a steaming
cup then begins

to call her son

Oh my lost Son
asking after her granddaughter

while the mitching girls

swagger out the door
— look, one forgot her

phone — ah good,

someone caught her — 
and who would begrudge the yin

and yang of this moment

sitting here
coming or going

anyone and no one

here or somewhere else
stuck nowhere and flowing

in the mix like everyone

for you are blurring
below indigo and ink-dim

skies as time passes

by like steam vapors into
the run-of-the-mill gray

coat you put on

pausing, before leaving
to meet this falling day

which as your granny

might say is the only
day you're in.

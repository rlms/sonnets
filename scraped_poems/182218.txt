In the sixth grade I was chased home by 
the Gatlin kids, three skinny sisters 
in rolled-down bobby socks. Hissing 
Brainiac! and Mrs. Stringbean!, they trod my heel. 
I knew my body was no big deal 
but never thought to retort: who's 
calling who skinny? (Besides, I knew 
they'd beat me up.) I survived 
their shoves across the schoolyard 
because my five-foot-zero mother drove up 
in her Caddie to shake them down to size. 
Nothing could get me into that car. 
I took the long way home, swore 
I'd show them all: I would grow up.

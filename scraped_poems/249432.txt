First, a black mark in the sky, 
                a speck that grows 

into a plane widening, 
                dramatically circling 
before it touches 
                a gray strip of land 
designed for its landing. 

Then the players descend 
                the wheeled stair 

to the stage 
                 for the cameras, 
our collective eye:

                first her, then him, 
as is custom, 
                and their entourage 
trailing behind, 

                those who believe 
the world is young 
                and the future spreads 
out like geography.

 It's the beginning 
                of all that, 
                and what a show it is, 

the bouquet of roses 
            we see given to her 
on the scratchy screen, 

the film pouring its light, 
                edges burned. 

And who knows what's truth, 
               what's myth, 
or if they arrive 
                as hawks or doves, 

brave with risk 
                in a bright and swirling
 land where the dust 
seems to crown 
               from its own gray dust.

Here's the raw footage. 
        Here's the film 
clicking in the projector, 

and, as all things seen 
                through it 
                are black and white, 
isn't it important to note 

                her roses are red 
and not yellow,

                and that neither of them 
squints in the bright Texas sun? 

If you can stand 
                what the light inside 
the darkness does 
                 to your eyes, 
                 watch them pause there 
for a moment: 
                 our champion, our grace, 

in that high noon 
                 that holds all 
the freshness of the morning.

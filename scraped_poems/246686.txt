Some girls        on the other side of this planet

                   will never know        the loveliness

       of   walking      in a crepe silk sari.      Instead, 

they will spend        their days                          on their backs 

   for a parade               of   men           who could be       their uncles

       in another life.         These girls memorize 

                    each slight wobble                  of   fan blade as it cuts 

       through the stale       tea air and auto-rickshaw 

                     exhaust,        thick as egg curry. 

Men         shove greasy rupees        at the door 

                      for one hour         in a room 

      with a twelve-year-old.                One hour —               One hour — 

             One hour.            And if   she cries afterward, 

   her older sister       will cover it up.         Will rim 

              the waterline             of   her eyes                 with kohl pencil 

                       until it looks like                        two silk moths 

                                have stopped      to rest       on her exquisite     face.

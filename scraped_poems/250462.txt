On the threshold of half a house in the Land of Israel 
my father stood
pointing to the sides and saying:
Upon these ruins
one day we will build a kitchen
to cook in it a Leviathan's tail
and a wild bull,
upon these ruins
we will build a corner for prayer
to make room 
for a bit of holiness.
My father remained on the threshold
and I, my entire life,
have been erecting scaffolding
reaching up to the sky.

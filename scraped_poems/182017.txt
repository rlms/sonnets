What is this about losing respect? 

Do I have to talk about it? 
He said he feared what I might 
write about him when he was gone, 
and I told him not to worry. 

He worried about the “streak of morbidity” in your work. 

He was a man of God, not of imagination. 

And it wasn't his fault if he got the shakes. 
It was a familial tremor, not nerves. 

And it first happened at a gravesite. 

Near where Brigham Young did his number—“this is the place.” 

He called him Friggin Young. 

Well, during his bleak tenure in Greenville, 
his congregants would tell nigger jokes 
and he would force a smile—afraid now to rock the boat— 
a mere exercise in stretching 
                the corners of his lips— 
a fake grin he would have noted 
on another face—false faces being 
            one of the things we loved 
to laugh about when together we observed congregants' idiosyncracies, 
their ruses, their guises, 

like one temple president, the son 
         of the “richest Jew in Salt Lake” 
who, seated in the pulpit's other red velvet wing chair, 
         would expose the holes in the soles of his shoes 
while he batted his eyelashes to 
         wake himself up— 

(though I owe him one: “Rosencavalier” 
didn't turn me in for copying 
         the wrong answers from Mary Weinstein 
on our “final exam” in Sunday 
         school prior to       confirmation. 

He was ashamed for me, 
                                          young Rosencavalier. 

He could hardly disguise 
         the curled lips and downcast eyes 
         of his contempt 
         for this lawless “Rabbi's son” 
         whether or not my name 
         was Strome or Rudman, 

but where teaching Judaism was concerned 
         his plodding methodical 
reading to keep up each week 
         was a pathetic substitution 
for Sidney's well-wrought, impromptu riffs. 

                                              So there!) 

Marty was ashamed of me. 
I left town. 

As night was falling?

In Utah you can drive at fifteen so by age 
fourteen a lot of our talk 
was hard core car talk 

and somehow the word 
Volkswagen came up 
after confirmation class 

(it was no GTO but you could drive 
so far on so little gas...) 
and Marty's father—a redhead like his son— 

made his way up the driveway's ice, 
smoke billowing from the exhaust 
of whatever sleek black foreign car he drove. 

Pulling on his elegant pigskin gloves 
he announced he'd “never buy a Kraut    car.” 
I was    bewildered 

(what, hold against a country now 
something that happened so long    ago?) 
and he held my gaze 

and I shivered inside the shiver I felt 
from the cold    I thought he would 
transmogrify into a southern sheriff 

and ask “what kind of    Jew are you    boy” 
but he didn't have to say 
another word.

In other words you were ready to leave town. 

I'd had it with Utah. 

But you wanted to stay in the west, against your father's wishes?  

Yes. 

Unequivocally? 

Yes. Yes. Yes. 

But you did submit to psychiatrists and interviews with the heads of schools 
during your sojourn in the east that summer?

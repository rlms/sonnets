On my way, I come upon themâ€”
 A gathering of old women
 Soaking their cracked, graying skin,
 Their thick bodies sprawling voluptuously:
 Knees bent,
 Curving out of the water,
 Heads thrown back in a tangle of vines and leaves.
 I pause a moment,
 Waiting to hear their voices echoing with years,
 Telling me what I need to know,
 But the sun has made them sleepy and secretive;
 I hear only their whispered laughter.
 They do not trust me;
 I am not yet ready to listen.

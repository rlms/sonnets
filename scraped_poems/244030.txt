I could make a wardrobe 
with tufts of wool 
caught on thistle and bracken.

Lost—the scraps 
I might have woven whole cloth.

Come watch, the man says, 
shearing sheep 
with the precision of long practice, 
fleece, removed all of a piece, 
rolled in a neat bundle.

I've been so clumsy 
with people who've loved me.

Straddling a ewe, 
the man props its head on his foot, 
leans down with clippers, 
each pass across the coat a caress.

His dogs, lying nearby, 
tremble at every move—as I do, 
loving the hands that have learned 
to gentle the life beneath them.

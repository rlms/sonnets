What I notice first within 
          this rough scene fixed
in memory is the rare 
          quality of its lightning, as if
those bolts were clipped 
          from a comic book, pasted
on low cloud, or fashioned 
          with cardboard, daubed
with gilt then hung overhead 
          on wire and fine hooks.
What I hear most clearly 
          within that thunder now
is its grief—a moan, a long 
          lament echoing, an ache.
And the rain? Raucous enough, 
          pounding, but oddly 
musical, and, well, 
          eager to entertain, solicitous.

No storm since has been framed 
          with such matter-of-fact 
artifice, nor to such comic 
          effect. No, the thousand-plus 
storms since then have turned 
          increasingly artless, 
arbitrary, bearing—every 
          one of them—a numbing burst.

And today, from the west a gust 
          and a filling pressure
pulsing in the throat—offering 
          little or nothing to make light of.

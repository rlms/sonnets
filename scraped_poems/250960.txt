Do you see current events differently because you were raised by a black father and are married to a black man?
I am surprised they haven't left already — 

things have gotten downright frosty, nearly unbearable.
A mob of them is apparently mouthing off outside

when I put down my newspaper and we all gather

to stand beside my daughter in the bay

of kitchen windows. Quiscalus quiscula: 

this name sounds like a spell which, after its casting,

will make things crumble into a complement

of unanswerable questions. Though, if you need me 


to tell you God's honest truth, I know nothing

but their common name the morning we watch them attack
our feeder. I complain about the mess they leave. Hulls


I'll have to sweep up or ignore. My father — 

who I am thankful is still alive — says We could use
a different kind of seed

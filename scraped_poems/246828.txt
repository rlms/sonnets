During the weeks when we all believed my mother 
was likely to die she began to plan 
her funeral and she wanted us, her children, 
to consider the music we would play there. We remembered 
the soundtrack of my mother's life: the years when she swept 
the floors to the tunes of an eight track cassette called Feelings, 
the Christmas when she bought a Bing Crosby album 
about a Bright Hawaiian Christmas Day. She got Stravinsky's 
Rite of Spring stuck in the tape deck of her car and for months 
each errand was accompanied by some kind
of dramatic movement. After my brother was born, 
there was a period during which she wore a muumuu 
and devoted herself to King Sunny Ade and his 
African beats. She ironed and wept to Evita, painted 
to Italian opera. Then, older and heavier, she refused 
to fasten her seatbelt and there was the music
of an automated bell going off every few minutes, 
which annoyed the rest of us but did not seem to matter 
to my mother who ignored its relentless disapproval, 
its insistence that someone was unsafe.

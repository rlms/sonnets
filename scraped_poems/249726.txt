('Operation Iraqi Freedom')
It felt odd from the start, this war.
 At the start, the 'death' of Saddam 
when Baghdad was bombed, but
               he's not dead, a bizarre
                          Zapata, 
and then the Scuds fired at  Kuwait
               but they weren't Scuds, 
the 'chemical weapons of mass destruction
 factory',  with earth banks and barbed wire
                  which wasn't one, however, 
and the 'column of tanks destroyed leaving Basra'
                    which was three tanks, 
the endless 'securing' of towns and cities
                      which aren't secure 
even allowing for the distinction 
that 'secure' does not mean 'safe', 
the 'Uprising' in Basra 
which no one could find there...

there were poems in inverted commas, this
is a war of inverted commas. Once 
I wrote that 'poems about poems 
don't seem as abstract as they once did'
(although you don't need quotes, quoting 
yourself) and the Oxford Companion decided 
this meant I was no longer being abstract,  when
in fact I meant that poems about poems
(in that case partly a child) 
are not abstract because the abstract 
in them works through to a deeper real. Will
this war work through to the deeper real 
at last? Now it seems again, however,
that it feels odd, this war. I have paid it 
careful attention for almost a fortnight and what 
I would note here is that singular oddness
of feeling it evokes: one is always
at a tangent to it somehow, albeit

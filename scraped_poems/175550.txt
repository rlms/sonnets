Some have learnt many Tricks of sly Evasion, 
Instead of Truth they use Equivocation, 
And eke it out with mental Reservation, 
Which to good Men is an Abomination. 
Our Smith of late most wonderfully swore, 
That whilst he breathed he would drink no more; 
But since, I know his Meaning, for I think 
He meant he would not breath whilst he did drink.

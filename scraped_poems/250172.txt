By living late, and sleeping late, we miss
 the moment when the bats come home to roost— 
when crooked shadows flit in jagged loops 
that seem to seek the chimney, seem to miss,

 then somehow disappear into the eaves; 
and they (the bats) tuck wing to fur to wing
 in crevices and roof-beam beveling, 
doze through our nearly diametric lives,

 invisible as brown on brown—until 
today, wakened by dreams, I caught a slight,
 compelling corner-glimpse in gray first light,

 of sudden motion in the mostly still 
new dawn; and drawn, I rose to see the flight: 
our dark companions exiting the night.

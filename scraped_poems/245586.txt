Fiddle no further, Führer. Rome is built.
It took all day. Now let us so
love the world. I'm just thinking out loud.
My stigmata bring out my eyes.

The smallpox uses every part of  the blanket,
and the forest is a lady's purse.
The Indian is a pink Chihuahua peeking 
his head from the designer zipper.

Out here it's mostly light from the fifteenth
century slamming into the planet.
I can't see the forest for the burn unit.
All the planet does is bitch bitch bitch.

I know it's last minute but could you put
out my eyes? At the subatomic level, 
helmeted gods help themselves to gold.
Up here? The body's an isolation ward.

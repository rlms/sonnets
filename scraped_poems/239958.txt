As a boy I bicycled the block
w/a brown mop top falling
into a tail bleached blond,

gold-like under golden light,
like colors of Noble Knights
'banging on corners, unconcerned

w/the colors I boreâ€”a shorty
too small to war with, too brown
to be down for the block.

White Knights became brown
Kings still showing black & gold 
on corners now crowned, 

the block a branch branded
w/la corona graffitied on
garage doors by the pawns.

As a teen, I could've beamed 
the crown, walked in w/out 
the beat down custom, 

warred w/my cousin 
who claimed Two-Six, 
the set on the next block

decked in black & beige.
But I preferred games to gangs,
books to crooks wearing hats

crooked to the left or right
fighting for a plot, a block
to spot & mark w/blood

of boys who knew no better
way to grow up than throw up
the crown & be down for whatever.

Hard to picture, but these Goliath trees 
are taller still than Robeson. Outside 
vast plate windows in this lecture hall, 
I imagine him running down autumn fields, 
see his black thighs pumping that machinery 
across chalk-painted lines. 

                                        He loved the woman 
in the lab, Eslanda, who saw order 
in swimming circles on inch-wide slides, who 
made photographs. I picture her standing 
in darkness, led by red light, bathing paper 
in broth, extracting images. Did this woman smile 
to watch white paper darken, to pull wet 
from the chemicals Paul Robeson's totem face?

How do you explain why elephants
appear to move their unwieldy hulks
with greater dignity than most humans do
in their finest moments,
as if they had evolved beyond wanting
anything but what they have?
Why does the field begin to ripple
before the wind arrives in whispers,
as if there were a communication,
as if the landscape were poorly dubbed,
and we weren't expected to notice?
What butterfly does not dart away from us
as if it could sense our latent cruelties,
and yet return to check and double-check? 
Has the night not gotten recently darker,
as if to insinuate that we have squandered 
the light that was there?
Have we made too much of our own?
And did you notice afterward the dawn 
opening up with a tentative eagerness
as if there were something crucial to illumine,
as if we would wake up early just to see it?
I imagine you reading this now 
with an expression of quiet trouble
itself troubled by currents of hope, 
as if you imagined me here with you, 
as if I might be able to see your expression,
and at least answer it with mine.

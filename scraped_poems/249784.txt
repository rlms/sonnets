I don't want to be alive anymore.
I don't want to be alive enough to want that.

One is not meant to turn on one's creator 
with ferocity expendable in only one way.

Or is that exactly how one is meant to turn 
to burn
 
beyond the love that from beyond being 
has come to us:

Christ's ever unhearable
 and thus always too bearable 
scream.

In love and dread we learn to listen 
for beloved dread

coming upon us like a whiplash rain 
we watch through a window.

In pain we learn pain.

Sometimes amid the rancid moonlight and mindlice of my insomnia
 there gleams a scalpel blade

so clean with meaning
so shaped and sharpened to interstellar blue

that drawing it —in season due — 
across my own throat

there comes not blood but an ancient answering 
starlight.

Once upon a time in a pleasingly modern slaughterhospice 
with a view of sky-contempted skyscrapers

and Lake Michigan's immaculate sewage 
my inner skin was skinned mouth to bowels,

my soul —deadword, die to find it.

For self-pity there must remain a self. 
Ah, but even shitting one's self

one still finds one's self hastening to hide it all 
from the kind Ukranian nearly bearded night nurse.

Fentanyl patches patching my stalactite thighs 
my diaphanous shoulders

the very air eating me
 like a late leaf

that once I would have flourished
 for a perishable lover

or lonelied like some catpiss poignancy 
into a poem.

Dead brain, living will, little pills 
entangling pain with adoration of it,

morphine machine whose little beep 
(heavenly bell)

conjures me to the suddenly more tolerable hallways 
of hell . . .
                         Lovely Leila,

so unsurgically curved,
disclosing as she leans to clean my lines

a bit of icelace undergarment like the very last trace
 of a glacier.

The brain the brain the brain flickering electrically 
in and out,

 in,
          out—

not the mind in which I love 
my wife

whose tightwound nightmind conjures Christ in diapers, 
for instance, filthy infant, or later,

in a mist of adolescent bad weather,
bored of wood, dogdead Judea, squawk-box God,

some restless absurdity of earth, she says, 
through which the rest of heaven can come.

Once upon a time I walked through the chemical glamour 
of a night refinery

sparking dangerously without and within 
for beside me under her underclothes

undulated an incarnation 
of creation's finest failure:

moonskin to make a young man wince 
coupled with stifling innocence.

Still, we managed.

And over the wrought-iron railing of the country club 
to which neither of us could possibly belong,

in the moonskinned pool that seemed both to embody and imbibe
 her, we improved.

And later, out on a green (to be sixteen!) 
when the starshower I thought was mine

was mining me for sweat, muscle, memory 
to make its own death

shine unceasingly inside of me, 
even unto hell,
                               we excelled.

Can it be that her last name was really Key?

So much life in this poem
so much salvageable and saving love

but it is I fear I swear I tear open 
what heart I have left

to keep it from being
and beating and bearing down upon me

What rest in faith 
wrested
               from grief

What truce
             with truth 
in bowing 
down

not to the ground 
of being
               but simply 
to the ground

Affliction flickers 
distant
               now 
like a structure 
on fire
              Love's 
reprieve 
moves through me

like a breeze

But antlike
             existence
 crawls all over me Lord
and I cry out
 if you call
             this vise 
quiet
              a cry 
this riot
of needs and genes 
an I

Feelingly
             among the
 bones
              and nerves 
of sounds
I make my scathing 
way
             Failingly 
in church
 or in the parked 
car
             before work 
I try
              to pray

What might it mean 
to surrender
              to the wonder 
nothing
                means
 
Not to end
              with a little flourish
                            of earth

Not to end

                                                                                                   Love is the living heart of dread
                                     
                                                                             Love I love you unto the very edge of being
 
                                                                                                                                                  Dead

Something in us suffering touches, 
teaches first to find

little coves in our loves: blank nothings 
wherein we are what we always were

              — blank nothings —

but changed or rearranged 
as atoms
               in the random
                             kingdom
                                           of things:

hand, we say, or eye, or hair,
as if to make ourselves — to stake ourselves — truly
there

Knowing now not to move in time 
we are moved
                        by tiger-striped tails 
bloodfine fins

some natureless cerulean 
one would say

thinking oneself 
out of nature

Something in us, suffering, touches, 
torches,
               so we may saunter 
seeingly
 through an altogether other

element,
as once in the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago

                I floated    a moment

with my love and the two new lives 
borne from us
                           who loved best 
the eensy
                  green
                               almost
                                              unfish

more like the stars

when you close your eyes and whirl 
open to the whirling

grains
 so freed from things
                                        you fall
                                                      down
                                                                 laughing
at the havoc

For me for a long time 
not the minnows mattered

but the pattern after: miraculous 
I didn't think

to think:
all those mite-eyes and animate instants

answering at once to my need 
and to nothing

as if my very nerves worked 
in finally a saving sense

Something in us touches 
suffering
                  touching
 us

like the constellations
 of kinetic quiet

that bound us beyond us
as right to the wall the girls pressed

their still-forming faces 
through which the wild new schools flew
                                                          almost
                                           too green
                             too blue
               to stand

And I held your hand.

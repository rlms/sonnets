He's 1200 pounds of pink pork covered by black 
bristles stiff enough to needle and sew with,
 Pretty Ricky, all six feet of him spread
 out, asleep, no fancy dancer, neither twirler 
nor prancer, just eats and sleeps, the biggest
 boar at the Fair, oblivious to gawkers, smirkers, 
cholesterol, or weight watchers, fat off the hoof,
 fat lying flat, good only for breeding and eating, 
he won't even stand to show off all the pork cuts
 displayed on the poster behind him: ham, it says, 
from the butt, oldest meat of civilized man;
 kabobs from the shoulder, roasted on swords
 by early Asian nomads; spareribs, sausage, 
and bacon from the belly. Pretty Ricky urges 
me to swear off pork, but it's lunchtime and my
 stomach wanders off to a foot-long or a brat with 
â€˜kraut. I think twice, three times, waffle back
 and forth between meat and a veggie wrap, as,
 in front of me, many meals stretch out, dozing.

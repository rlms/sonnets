Game of Thrones
In this story, she is fire-born:
knee-deep in the shuddering world.

In this story, she knows no fear,
for what is fractured is a near-bitten star,
a false-bearing tree,
or a dishonest wind.

In this story, fear is a house gone dry.
Fear is not being a woman. 

I'm no ordinary woman, she says.
My dreams come true.

And she says and she is 
and I say, yes, give me that.

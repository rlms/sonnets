There's a lot going on in
“the”
zombie apocalypse.

But wouldn't she recognize
that her mother
was a zombie?

I mean zombies
are a thing.

The last thing she did
was point
to one corner of the ceiling

with a horrified stare.
The nurse called this “a seizure.”

As if words
drained experience
of content and continued

to accumulate.

As if words
were sealed containers
stored for safe keeping.

The background
is everything

that, for now,
can be safely

ignored

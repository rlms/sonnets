Aunt Martha bustles
 From room to room
 Between attic and basement,
 With duster and broom.
  
 Like an oven grenade,
 In cobwebby corners
 Her broom explodes
 A babel of wonders.
  
 Her summer crusade
 Havocs the bugs.
 Like an enfilade,
 She rakes the rugs.
  
 The sound and fury
 Of table and bed
 Whirs a panic of sparrows
 To the oaks overhead.
  
 Untenable grows
 The vast of the house
 For even the ghost
 Of Lazarus' mouse.
  
 The fogies convert
 Back fences to staffs
 And sow their gossip
 With Pharisee laughs:
  
 Aunt Martha's scowl
 Is a lithograph's.
  
 As the fogies watch
 Her attic lairs
 Jettison the junk
 Of heirloom wares,
 She shouts: “Old houses
 Need cleaning upstairs!”

The host's girlfriend is barely seen.

 She's busy giving away
wild animals to reluctant guests.

               I agree to take a snake-dog,
maybe an electric eel, but when
I feel its sharp teeth in my shoulder,

I start to worry about
the future welfare of our fragile cat,
the precarious order of our rented home,

and remember
I am supposed to be looking for someone....

                A half-wolf, half-elephant
cracks through the walls
of the peeling wallpapered bedroom

where my former student
in a fuschia robe and curlers sits
by a lighted make-up mirror.

The shadows off elongated fake eyelashes are as dark
as the branches of an evening tree.

The hovering body of a fiery sparrow is almost
transparent,

like flute music or an idea.

I turn my back
                and finally, I spot her
                my friend, the host.

She's sipping rum punch from a martini glass;
her whole body appears to be smiling, glowing,

and I don't know what to think.

I know she doesn't drink, hasn't in decades,
and I wonder what's suddenly changed, but
then I remember

the cancer won,
my friend isn't actually
here, there is no party,
there was never a house.

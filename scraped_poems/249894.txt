I was thinking: God has abandoned me,
So, what of it—he is a priceless ray of light,
Or a thin needle in the haystack of man. And cruel.
I have turned away from him—torment me no more.
But which of us is more cruel? More to be feared?
The one who has no body, of course.
He has made us endless, vast—
So that our grief will know no bounds.


Providence, 2001

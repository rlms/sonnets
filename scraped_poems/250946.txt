The child is not dead.
She is sleeping. 

Gone from this world
Which is broken.

The angel of Michael
Outside the garden
His circle of fire 
Maddening around the tree. 

He put the word 
Back into her:
A heavy kind of music.

Then she was free.
As we all are.

All night I stood in the icy wind, 
Praying for the storm to destroy me.

But the wind blew through me
Like I was a hologram.

If you say I am a mystic,
Then fine: I'm a mystic.

The trees are not trees, anyway.

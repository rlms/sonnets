Words can bang around in your head
 Forever, if you let them and you give them room.
 I used to love poetry, and mostly I still do, 
Though sometimes “I, too, dislike it.” There must be 
Something real beyond the fiddle and perfunctory
Consolations and the quarrels—as of course
There is, though what it is is difficult to say.
The salt is on the briar rose, the fog is in the fir trees.
I didn't know what it was, and I don't know now,
But it was what I started out to do, and now, a lifetime later,    
All I've really done.

Carnival morning they
  were Greeks in Brazil,
    Africans in Greek
disguise. Said of herself
                                            she
       was born in a house in
    heaven. He said he was
     born in the house next
 door... They were in hell.
   In Brazil they were
                                       lovebait.
      To abide by hearing was
         what love was... To 
       love was to hear without
    looking. Sound was the
                                               beloved's
     mummy cloth... All to say,
 said the exegete, love in
    hell was a voice, to be spoken
  to from behind, not be able
     to turn and look... It
   wasn't Greece where they 
                                                  were,
 nor was it Benin... Carnival
morning in made-up hell, bodies
    bathed in loquat light, would-be
 song's all the more would-be
     title, “Sound and Cerement,”
                                                          voice
      wound in bandages
   raveling
                lapse

                  .

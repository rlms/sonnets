Homeless and never sadder,
dragging bags, spending money,
leaning over luggage,
suddenly saying, “Without you, God,
I can't continue.” Who was that?

And then I lift it and walk 
to find one book.

Up Iffley Turn to the Hawkwell and Tree Inns
and down over a lock
into an extended filthy river
through the Thames Valley
and over a meadow into town:
two fats,
one fishing and one man on a bike
swerving through Cotswold cow pads.
I ask:
“Do you know the fastest way
to City Centre?”

No, yes, no!

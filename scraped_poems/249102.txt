Cold cry from the last page of  the dictionary,
name with a knife in it, and the knife
italic against the throat

till you fall into so heavy a sleep — 
sleep made of asterisks and cattle,
the herd just a black scarf

against snow — you can't begin to guess
where the old world went. Now there are only two 
choices, says the tale, and neither is good.

Hence an axe above each separate entrance
as the hero becomes hardly a voice
and the sad dogs appear on the screen.

Then there is a thin, high scraping.
Then no noise of any sort at all.

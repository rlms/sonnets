It could have been a car door
                leaving that bruise,

as any mom knows,
almost anything could take an eye out,

and almost anybody could get their tongue
                 frozen to a pole,

which is kind of funny
                 to the point of tears
                 plus a knee slap or two
that an eye can be made blue, pink
by a baby's fist, it fits
perfectly in the socket. It's happened to me.
                 Get it?

Any scenario is better,
beats sitting in a car and hearing
                 someone you love
                 sob,
which I have done
with a black eye.

For me, a woman's tears
are IKEA instructions
on the European side.

I'm sure for Laius, Oedipus's father, it was the same.
                Think of him sleeping
after having held a crying Jocasta
because they had fought for hours
because she was stronger.

                 Who knew better the anger of young Jocasta?
Knew that when the oracle, or the police,
                 come, they are taking someone with them.

I'm sure Laius looked at the crib
                 and thought better you
than me, kid.

Imagine you wake up 
with a second chance: The blue jay 
hawks his pretty wares 
and the oak still stands, spreading 
glorious shade. If you don't look back, 

the future never happens. 
How good to rise in sunlight, 
in the prodigal smell of biscuits - 
eggs and sausage on the grill. 
The whole sky is yours 

to write on, blown open 
to a blank page. Come on, 
shake a leg! You'll never know 
who's down there, frying those eggs, 
if you don't get up and see.

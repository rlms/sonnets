The lies I could tell, 
when I was growing up 
light-bright, near-white, 
high-yellow, red-boned 
in a black place, 
were just white lies.

I could easily tell the white folks 
that we lived uptown, 
not in that pink and green 
shanty-fled shotgun section 
along the tracks. I could act 
like my homemade dresses 
came straight out the window 
of Maison Blanche. I could even 
keep quiet, quiet as kept,
 like the time a white girl said
 (squeezing my hand), Now 
we have three of us in this class.

But I paid for it every time
Mama found out.
She laid her hands on me,
then washed out my mouth
with Ivory soap. This
is to purify, she said,
and cleanse your lying tongue.
Believing her, I swallowed suds
thinking they'd work
from the inside out.

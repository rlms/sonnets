A field of thistles, díscharging 
                  concentric waves of negative 
                                       theology, on a mountainside, 
                  2010, May 23rd (is Whitsuntide),
would certainly
suffice as a source of the ever-obtainable not 
enough sought 
state of subtle shock 
if he'd close 
this computer 
                  and walk up the summit road 
                  until the sea's in view. And maybe in 
                  the southeast wind, 
                  in broadcast waveform data therein,
                  microsystems stocks he has been
checking, clicking all day like an addict gambler, will 
                                                                                      float up until 
red numbers cross the black horizon 
into green—two redtail hawks                                float up 
                                                                                      on a thermal—
maybe even make some money while you're up here—
ask why is each second so
                             charged with a feeling of living in freak
Götterdämmerung days
of live free radical notion or die into negative white on white sun pride
burning away, but equally
                             charged with utopian headlong longevity crowing—
why can't I be steady? 
Why is my only 
balance built 
of collisions and 
cancelings-out of such sharp spike-of-chaos moods?

Field of thistles, 
red and green. 

Fields of dollars, thistles, 
solidi and yen 
and rand and rupees blowing off the curve of land.

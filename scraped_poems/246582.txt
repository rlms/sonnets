After snowstorms my father 
shoveled the driveway where it lay 
open to a sweep of wind across

a neighbor's field, where the snow 
drifted half way down to the paved 
road, before snow-blowers, before

pick-ups cruised the streets with 
THE BOSS lettered on red plows. 
He heated the flat shovel

in the woodstove till the blade 
steamed, like Vulcan at his furnace 
removing the dross, then rubbed

a hissing candle on the steel 
so the snow would slide unchecked 
as he made each toss. He marked

blocks with the waxed blade, lifted 
and tossed, lifted and tossed again, 
squaring off against the snow.

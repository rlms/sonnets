Somebody left this white T-shirt
like a hangman's hood on the new parking meterâ€”
the magic marks upon its back say: I QUIT METH 4-EVER. 
A declaration to the sky, whose angels all wear seagull wings
swooping over this street with its torn scratch tickets
and Big Gulp cups dropped by the curb.

Extra large, it has been customized
with a pocketknife or a canine tooth
to rough the armholes where my boobs wobble out
as I roam these rooms lit by twilight's bulb,
feeling half like Bette Davis in a wheelchair
and half like that Hell's Angels kingpin with the tracheotomy.

Dear reader, do you know that guy?
I didn't think so. If only we could all watch the same TV.
But no doubt you have seen the gulls flying,
and also the sinister bulked-up crows
carrying white clouds of hotdog buns in their beaks:
you can promise them you'll straighten up, but they are such big cynics.

I should have told you My lotto #'s 2-11-19-23-36

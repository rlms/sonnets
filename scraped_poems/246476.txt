I find it helpful to imagine writing in a blizzard
             with every inscription

designed to prevent snow
             crystals from drifting in.

Avoid the hive mind. Go fly a kite,
raise a stained glass window in the sky.

It's the opposite of making love to drudgery,
             what I do for a dying.

       Remove the bitter sediment
trapped in the brewer. It will be new

whether you make it new
or not. It will be full of neo-

shadows. Full of then — both past and next,
iridescent with suspense. Remember

             time is not the treasure revealer.
More a midge larva creeping

through a waterfall releasing
suction feet. The curiosity rover

       lands on Mars! New is a hooligan.
It breaks the reckoning frame and rests

in pieces. Let me collect its dna
from the tears on your desk.

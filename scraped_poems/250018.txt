Seaside, and the fragment of one running—
calves, ribs, green eyes into water. 
There he goes. Waves. Buoying up 
as into sky. And the seagulls fly, 
seeing it as relief, a story. Once

they were there, two on a white blanket.
The circumference of a shadow.
Sunlight around that shadow.
The relation of two: bathers,
robed figures configured as one.
And she touches him—tender—and it is done.

(I've gone back to it. I've, I've—
it's not where I am. I give it away again.)
You're there. It's still in the sand.
It's trying to chisel it in.

How it comes forth: the story. 
Wanting it, carving it down to vision. 
Architecture, a coliseum of bent light, 
the beautiful scatter of broken stones. 
(And I can turn it into stones.) 
Love, love: a portico, a labyrinth.

And his simple aquatics, legs and arms 
in the brackish, etched against white fish.

The song, under there, of how he'll leave,
 and naturally, like all living things: 
animals, summer, daylight for the eves.

And the buildings, all shadows and beings: 
block, angels, curves. With the love, 
memory of all loves. The pediments,
 these reliquaries.

It's our landscape, artifact—it might hurt. 
(Run to, run away from it.)

It wasn't a man 
That knocked me down 
With the thrill of a slice
Of my will. 

She was mannish, 
Chilled, flung
Her will across
Mine then laughed

At my shock, when she
Gripped my neck while
Lingering over a request
For the evening meal. 

Later I sliced a tomato
Close to my wrist. 
The door was open. 
She had warned me: 

Never shut it against
Her. Otherwise 
I was free to come 
And go. Maybe she was

Right: I was zero 
To the bone. Meanwhile,
I had left the hose 
In the pond. The goldfish

Cowered in the reeds. 
Whose side were they on?
I am ill, I thought, 
Slogging across

Soggy green.
If I bow any lower
I will be looking up
At moss.

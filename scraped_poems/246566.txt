Snow falls gently in the Hill Country 
covering the meadows and the valleys. 
The sluggish streaks of smoke climb quietly 
from the roofs but fail to reach the lazy clouds.

On Alamo Plaza in the heart of the night 
and under the flood of lights, the flakes float 
like frozen moths and glow like fireflies. 
They drop on the blades of dormant grass.

They alight on the cobblestones and live awhile 
in silence, they dissolve before dawn. 
The wet limestone walls of the mission 
glow proudly after the night of snowfall.

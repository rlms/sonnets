I don't know how fast I was going
but, even so, that's still
an intriguing question, officer,
 and deserves a thoughtful response.
 With the radio unfurling
 Beethoven's Ode to Joy, you might
 consider anything under 80 sacrilege.
 Particularly on a parkway as lovely
 as the one you're fortunate enough
 to patrol—and patrol so diligently.
 A loveliness that, if observed
 at an appropriate rate of speed,
 affords the kind of pleasure
 which is in itself a reminder
 of how civilization depends
 on an assurance of order and measure,
 and the devotion of someone
 like yourself to help maintain it.
 Yes, man the measurer!
 The incorrigible measurer.
 And admirably precise measurements
 they are—Not, of course, as an end
 in themselves but, lest we
 forget, as a means to propel
 us into the immeasurable,
 where it would be anybody's guess how fast
 the west wind was blowing
 when it strummed a rainbow
 and gave birth to Eros.
 Never forget that a parkway
 is a work of art, and the faster
 one goes the greater the tribute
 to its power of inspiration,
 a lyrical propulsion that approaches
 the spiritual and tempts—demands
 the more intrepid of us
 to take it from there.
 That sense of the illimitable,
 when we feel we are more the glory
 than the jest or riddle of the world
—that's what kicked in, albeit
 briefly, as I approached
 the Croton Reservoir Bridge.
 And on a night like this, starlight
 reignited above a snowfall's last
 flurry,  cockeyed headlights scanning
 the girders overhead, eggshell
 snowcrust flying off the hood,
 hatching me on the wing
 like a song breaking through prose,
 the kind I usually sing
 through my nose:

       So much to love,
           A bit less to scorn.
           What have I done?
           To what end was I born?

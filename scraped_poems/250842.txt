Down, unequal weight on his haunches
and the rain driving his shirt sideways,
his legs are as rigid as the stone and timber
that props him up. Ears, half-opened lips
slurred to bits; a head no longer able
to troubleshoot the broken glass inside him.

Wiry treetops are blacker. The after-rain light
diffused to near neon-gray. There was a boy
seen by neighbors running the width of the field.
One said he disappeared — as if he fell headlong
into the horizon. Another said it wasn't a boy,
but a hart. Next to nothing left where Evans
was found, but there was a sound box,
some thing in which his soul made itself felt.

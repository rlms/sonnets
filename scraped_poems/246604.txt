The cruelest thing I did to my dog 
wasn't to ignore his barking for water 
when his tongue hung like a deflated balloon

or to disregard his chronic need for a belly rub 
but to teach him to shake hands, 
a trick that took weeks of treats, his dark eyes

like Greek olives, moist with desire. 
I made him sit, another injustice, 
and allowed him to want the nuggets enough

to please me. Shake, I said. Shake? 
touching the back of his right leg 
until he lifted it, his saliva trickling

from soft jowls, my hand wet with his hunger. 
Mistress of the biscuit, I ruffled his ears 
and said good dog until he got it. Before long,

he raised his paw, shook me until he got 
the treat, the rub, the water in a chilled silver bowl, 
the wilderness in him gone, his eyes still lit with longing.

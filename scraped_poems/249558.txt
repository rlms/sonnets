The afternoon we left our first apartment, 
we scrubbed it down from ceiling to parquet. 
Who knew the place could smell like lemon muffins? 
It suddenly seemed nuts to move away. 

The morning someone bought our station wagon, 
it gleamed with wax and every piston purred. 
That car looked like a centerfold in Hot Rod! 
Too late, we saw that selling was absurd. 

And then there was the freshly tuned piano 
we passed along to neighbors with a wince. 
We told ourselves we'd find one even better;
 instead we've missed its timbre ever since. 

So if, God help us, we are ever tempted
 to ditch our marriage when it's lost its glow, 
let's give the thing our finest spit and polishâ€” 
and, having learned our lesson, not let go.

Whereas the porch screen sags from
 the weight of flowers (impatiens) that grew
 against it, then piles of wet leaves,
 then drifted snow; and

Whereas, now rolled like absence in its
 drooping length, a dim gold wave,
 sundown's last, cast across a sea of clouds
 and the floating year, almost reaches
 the legs of the low-slung chair; and

Whereas between bent trees flies
and bees twirl above apples
 and peaches fallen on blue gravel; and

Whereas yesterday's thunder shook blossoms
 off laurel the day after they appeared; and

Whereas in the dust, the fine and perfect
 dust of cat-paw prints scattered across
 the gleaming car hood, something
 softer than blossoms falls away,
 something your lips left on mine; and 

Whereas it's anyone's guess as to how long
 it's been since a humid day sank so low,
 so far from the present that missing
 sensations or the sensation of something
 missing have left impressions in the air,
 the kind a head leaves on a pillow; and

Whereas the last of ancient, unconvincing
 notions evaporate from the damp pages
 of thick, old books that describe how,
 for instance, Time and Love once
 lay together here; how in a slurred flash
 of light she turned and waded back
 into the sea, and how the slack
 part of any day was and is
 all in the way he, half
 asleep, felt her hand slip out of his; and

Whereas, the blue heron stands on the shore;
 while the sleek heron turns, broad
 to narrow, half hidden among the reeds;
 turning with the stealth, the sweep
 of twilight's narrowing minute,
 of stillness taking aim; turning
 until it almost disappears into
 the arrowhead instant the day disappears,
 until, staring out of the reeds,
 the aforementioned heron
 is more felt than seen; and

Whereas, you, with due forethought
 and deliberation, bite into
 an apple's heart and wish it were your own

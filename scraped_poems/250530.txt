Detective Hardwood looks like Batman this morning 
pouty cupidy mouth
and a lot of black sculptural clanking
the statuary in my mortuary, 
the Masonic Hall having burned again in dreams 
but everyone still keeps skipping towards it
it's a hollow a round shell 
my life as the shape of the ways I've been fucked 
by prevailing thought & practice 
all the conscious and unconscious sexisms
selfishnesses affluences assumptions suppressions in drift

GET   RID   OF   ALL   CONTROLS—is what the Soul keeps screaming.

I sleep-walked in a dream to a man's apartment—
a man I'm doing business with— 
I forgot, but how could I? how I'd gotten there,
 and when I die will I remember all such forgotten things 

GET   RID   OF   THE   CONTROLS
                                                                          I want to
remember now.

I apologized to the man for not adhering to office hours 
it was four a.m. Office hours are better he said.

Don't arrive anywhere in your sleep 
don't mix up night and day
soul and detective. No.

They broke your day
they fought it you
forgot how advantageous
to be fit with god and not see eye
you forgot gold sun brilliant
in this story
go in conscious.

those eyes saw raw smells and gods everywhere dusty

this dust I was truly assembled from 
at least as you, we are communally 
such.

If you say you'll hurt me, do you 
really mean me

I  can't be, can I, hurt?

Later.
I have a drop of blood on a front tooth
I kind of don't mind—
This the list of what we've done:

         It was different structure we killed it 
         put beasts in the refrigerator
         and that was almost as bad as my own enslavement.
         Then I saw Christ's blood pumped into a rejuvenating mummy.
         This great sickness we're part of apple clot 
         and can you really chew it detective
         Oh sure I can, I'm Robert Mitch-ham.

I'm sort of hysterical

the E is it for hope, cutting

the E might be for Hope

Nope

and bloody, the bloodiest is Hope.

Where are the E's of exactness?

E is my middle name
